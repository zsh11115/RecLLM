Memories of the all-or-nothing style of her mother, Judy Garland, are already heavy in the air by the time Minnelli reaches ""My Mammy,"" and workouts on ""God Bless the Child"" and ""Son of a Preacher Man"" confirm the singer\'s approach.', 'As for Fosse\'s choreography, there are signature moves aplenty--his dancing so frequently suggested a choreographer lusting for actual sex to break out on stage. ""Bye Bye Blackbird"" gives Minnelli and her backup dancers a chance to stretch out in an echt-Fosse feast of bowler hats and white gloves. The bell-and-booty shaking in ""Ring Them Bells"" and the loony tuxedo-clad cowpokes in ""I Gotcha"" hint that Fosse was in the midst of a manic phase. Speaking of which, Minnelli tackling Joe Tex\'s ""I Gotcha"" is one of those jaw-dropping mismatches that she salvages only through dint of daft commitment. No quarreling with the <I>Cabaret</I> medley; say want you want about Liza, she owns those songs. Minnelli and Fosse won Emmys for the show. The restoration of the original materials looks about as good as can be expected, with the spirit of a glitzy seventies TV variety special quite intact. <I>--Robert Horton</I>']"

Deciding whether to play it on the way to morning kindergarten or during brunch for your mellow sweetheart, then, can be brutal. But the choice to buy it or bypass it shouldn\'t be.

In short, Pain of Salvation\'s music may be the musical equivalent of reading a Samuel Beckett or James Joyce novel, the kind of stimulating and challenging endeavor that few will undertake and even fewer will see through to the end, although those who do complete the perilous intellectual journey will find the sum of the parts richly rewarding as it fuels the powers of both the intellect and the imagination.--<i>Jedd Beaudoin</i>']"

Ferry\'s ageless tenor injects a modern momentum into early Dylan imprints ""Positively 4th Street"" (with strings!), ""All I Really Want to Do,"" and ""The Times They Are A-Changing,"" and gloriously respects the more recent ""Make You Feel My Love"" (from 1997\'s <i>Time out of Mind</i>). But the best is yet to come, as the oft-covered ""Knockin\' on Heaven\'s Door"" may never have received better treatment and ""Baby, Let Me Follow You Down"" loses not a beat of its original knock-down luster.

The perfect album to enjoy with a Tall Espresso Roast because both are smooth and balanced with a slightly sweet finish."", '""Many years from now"" must have seemed like an understatement to 16-year-old Paul McCartney, wondering if he\'d still be needed or fed at the age of 64. As it turned out, all doubt as to the latter had ceased by his 22nd birthday (though few could have predicted he\'d end up washing down those meals with the liquid pride of Seattle). As to the former? Now that McCartney, as of the date of this album\'s release, has reached that mythic age, his greatest work is 40 years behind him, his solo peak over 30 years gone. Does the world need a new Paul McCartney album? The answer is yes, at least as much as it needs anything else that passes for music these days. With <i>Memory Almost Full</i>, Macca is back. No, it\'s not <i>Ram</i> or <i>Band on the Run</i>. It might not even be <i>Flowers in the Dirt</i>--in 1989, he had a full band, the support of Linda, and Elvis Costello as a collaborator. Here, he\'s on his own. Literally: on the majority of the tracks, everything but the strings is multi-instrumentalist Paul. But the surprise is that it\'s one of his freest, loosest affairs in years, sonically reminiscent of the <i>Tug of War/Pipes of Peace</i> era with nods to <i>Abbey Road</i> in the album-closing medley, McCartney\'s gravelly tones on ""Gratitude,"" and 2007\'s version of ""Her Majesty,"" the palate-cleansing ""Nod Your Head."" It\'s a surprise because of the album\'s inescapable sense of retrospection (""Ever Present Past,"" ""Vintage Clothes,"" ""That Was Me"") and even a bit of weariness. The next-to-last song is ""The End of the End,"" after all, in which McCartney tells us about what he\'d like to happen ""on the day that I die."" (He wants ""songs that were sung/to be hung out like blankets/that lovers have played on/and laid on while listening to songs that were sung,"" and will likely get his wish.) But it never gets overwhelming, for McCartney mostly resists his tendency to get plodding and maudlin. In fact, <i>Memory Almost Full</i> must be the most sanguine album made during the dissolution of a marriage since...well, ever. ""What went out is coming back,"" he sings in ""Vintage Clothes,"" and from the sound of things, that may not be just wishful thinking. What\'s past is prologue; if we\'re lucky, what to come may be McCartney\'s late renaissance. <i>--Benjamin Lukoff</i>']"

Good examples are platinum selling artists John Legend and Musiq. So Much Better continues the legacy of his 2000 release Emotional which contained multi-format hits Wish and Summer Rain. Now in \'07 Carl is back under the tutelage of legendary music man Jheryl Busby and producer, friend, and the man responsible for I Wish and You Ain\'t Right Mike City, whos credit include Brandy, Usher, Dave Hollister and many more. This latest release will continue to pull on the heart strings of Carl\'s fan base in the urban mainstream and adult urban demographic. The lead single 2 Pieces is already having success at radio as the #1 most added single at urban AC, with major markets such as NY, WDC, Chicago, and Music Choice are already on board. So Much Better features the likes of multi platinum producers and artists Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis w/Big Jim Wright, Brain Michael Cox, Brandy, Dave Hollister, Lalah Hathaway and Pitch Black to formulate this testimony to vintage classic soul music. Carl\'s new album So Much Better will be marketed heavily in Carl\'s top 15 sales markets.

Thomas\'s knack for delivering both groups the soul-stirring, love-centric songs that thrill them is no small thing--his ability to dig beneath a song\'s shiny surface and pull out pure emotion would do his iconic predecessors proud. Plus, he makes it all seem easy: midtempo tracks like the reggae-fied ""On No (You Can\'t Be Serious),"" on which his voice takes on tinges of John Legend, send out bursts of genuine joy, while straight-up love laments like ""2 Pieces"" land on the ears with a believability so real it almost burns. <I>--Tammy La Gorce</I>']"

A big chunk of the appeal is that Prince finds his way back to his guitar here. The title track, a politically right-on-time environmental rant, steers him back toward ""Purple Rain"" territory, as does ""Lion of Judah"" (""Guitar,"" oddly, doesn\'t--it\'s more of a straight-up, shout-it-out modern rocker).

Yes, it\'s startling to see her sporting Buck Rogers boots and wielding a glittery, oversized silver guitar. And what\'s up with the comic book images that make up the CD booklet? But if Tunstall is feeling a bit like her overnight success is something out of interplanetary fiction, the new graphic ""positioning"" doesnt mean the Scottish singer-songwriter has gone full-blown, diva-fied pop-rock. Rather, she\'s built on the success of the euphorically catchy ""Suddenly I See"" and ""Black Horse and the Cherry Tree"" to craft the bouncy kiss-off of ""I Don\'t Want You Now,"" and the hypnotic beat of ""Hold On,"" with its lyrical warning (shades of Bob Marley\'s ""Judge Not"") of karma and responsibility. The new repertoire, like her sensual, slightly slurred singing, is more authoritative, polished, and less bluesy and rough-edged as <i>Eye&#133</i>, despite a British urban influence. But Tunstall paves her continuum by again using producer Steve Osborne (U2, New Order, Happy Mondays), and with two songs she recorded for the first album--the driving pop-rock of the anti-plastic surgery anthem ""Saving My Face"" (with its irresistible ""ooh-oohs"" lifting the mood), and ""Funnyman,"" a pop-alt-folk sonic blend that flirts with electronica. Best of all, Tunstall, who veers from playing a little electric lead guitar to ukulele on the album, is decidedly intent on reprising the spare framework of the songwriter. ""White Bird,"" the most memorable of the four songs that spotlight her poetic, pensive side, amounts to a meditation (""Half of you is heavenly/Showing off your purity""). But whether meant as a metaphor or a literal descriptive paean, a la the romantic 19th-century poets, this melancholy, quiet song finds the 32-year-old musician more confident and on top of her craft than anything on her delicious debut. On the whole, then, this solid sophomore album isn\'t really such a ""drastic"" turn. But you just might agree with the second half of her title. <i>--Alanna Nash</i>']"

MGMT is: Andrew Vanwyngarden and Ben Goldwasser, two psychic pilgrims whose paths first intersected in the green pastures of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, circa 2002. The pair was drawn to the music of other duos and found themselves incorporating the implications of the hallucinatory power-twee of the Incredible String Band, the roaring subway minimalist Electronica of Suicide, the silky Pop-Soul of Hall & Oates, the pulsing narcotic trance of Spacemen 3, the avant-garde Industrial romanticism of Royal Trux and much more into the constantly evolving sounds of MGMT.

MGMT seemingly submit this debut album as an application to acquire and even supersede The Flaming Lips\' previously uncontested mantle as spiritual leaders of over-sized Technicolor psychedelic-indie with a soul, weird but not so weird that swelling crowds and even flirtations with the charts aren\'t a foregone conclusion. ""Time to Pretend"" opens and sets a tone for the record, producer David Fridmann (Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev) providing a familiar expanse for them to riff across with bull\'s-eye synths, massive drums and their twist on the template--retro 80s electro and abstract shapes, see Suicide and the Talking Heads for reference. ""The Youth"" is centred around a hypnotically looping refrain that recalls Pink Floyd and David Bowie, as interpreted by a mellow Secret Machines and the brilliant ""Pieces of What"" is Ryan Adams spinning through cosmos with classic Neil Young on his headphones. ""Future Reflections"" meanwhile stand on its hands on a line somewhere in-between XTC and Ween. Thrillingly eclectic, endlessly colourful and never predictable.

It too went gold. Two years later Wayne released The Carter, the first album in the trilogy that would elevate Wayne to superstar status. The Carter (2004) was a commercial success selling over one million copies and reaching #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 Charts and #2 on the Hot R&B/Hip Hop chart.

The five young members of Fleet Foxes make up a very different sort of rock band, describing their own music as ""baroque harmonic pop jams"". Even that understates the depths of the quintet\'s effortless vocal harmonies and gently woozy, folky feel. Of their contemporaries only the enigmatic Midlake and My Morning Jacket at their most fragile come close, but neither could have cooked up the Beach Boys spiritual of ""White Winter Hymnal"" or its more powerful companion piece ""Ragged Wood"". In fact Fleet Foxes happily admit to aspiring to an earlier tradition--not just obvious antecedents like the Byrds, the Association, Neil Young and, especially, David Crosby\'s famously unfocussed solo album <i>If Only I Could Remember My Name</i> but ancient English folk songs and their later American descendents. All were hunted and gathered from the internet--songwriters Robin Pecknold and Skye Skjelset are barely in their twenties. Add a host of unlikely instruments and the results are stunning, the complete antithesis of mainstream stadium indie that has followed Arcade Fire. Still, the cover features a Bruegel painting of peasants that might have graced any Black Sabbath sleeve. In that way at least Fleet Foxes salute a local tradition. <i>-Steve Jelbert</i>']"

Given his mood, a song performed on one day can seem like an entirely different composition on the next. On the two-CD Tell Tale Signs: The Bootleg Series Vol. 8--certainly one of the most riveting of the Minnesota bard\'s collections of unreleased recordings, studio demos, alternate takes, and live tracks--two versions of ""Mississippi,"" which Dylan originally wrote for Time Out of Mind, bear that out. The first, where he is backed only by producer Daniel Lanois\' poignant electric guitar, finds him wistful in his memories of Rosie. But by disc two, where he reprises the song with a whole band, his reading of the same lyric is dispassionate, as if he were recounting the experience of ""the stranger that nobody sees,"" as he puts it. While the second rendition disappoints, the 27-song album, which covers material from 1989\'s Oh Mercy through 2006\'s Modern Times, offers a king\'s riches. In replacing the banjo with cranked-up electric guitars on a blistering live performance of ""High Water (For Charley Patton),"" he makes the song nearly an angry manifesto. (Another live song, ""Ring Them Bells,"" thrills with the stunning raw power of his early performances, and renders the studio original utterly bland.) Not everything seems up to Dylan\'s remarkable standards (conjuring a black R &amp; B voice for ""Can\'t Escape From You,"" an homage to early rock and roll, seems off kilter and silly). But the breadth and scope of the material (from sneering and tender folk originals, to covers of Jimmie Rodgers and Robert Johnson blues, to a collaboration with bluegrass king Ralph Stanley, and side excursions into ragtime and waltz) reinforce his position as the premier songwriter of his generation. <em>-&ndash; Alanna Nash</em>']"

It is certainly his most fully realised, and also his most intimate by far. There are reasons for this: the man who is arguably the best interpreter of any song he chooses to sing irrespective of genre has now, at last, turned songwriter. For the first time in his career, Tom has had a major hand in writing most of the songs collected here. Surrounding himself with a musically diverse group of producers and songwriters, Tom set about creating songs that would be big and impassioned and cinematic. Inspired by the kind of soul-searching that, he says, comes to us all sooner or later, much of '24 Hours' concerns those subjects closest to Tom's heart - his family, his grandchildren, life and death, and the power of memory. '24 Hours', his first album for Parlophone/S Curve, was recorded in Los Angeles throughout last year, and was mostly produced by Future Cut, the drum 'n' bass outfit who have previously worked with Lily Allen, Dizzee Rascal and Goldie.""]"

Don&rsquo;t be fooled. <em>Circus</em> differs from <em>Blackout</em> in a number of ways, the most important being that 1) it keeps its ringmasters--i.e., its producers--in check instead of allowing them to run an overly sleek show, and 2) Brit brings it vocally here in a way she hasn&rsquo;t since 2003&rsquo;s <em>In the Zone</em> (check ""Kill the Lights,"" on which she channels her mentor Madonna and the liquid-y ""Blur"").

Nominated for a BET Award for Best New Artist as well as two Grammy\'s, I Am was both a critical success and a fans delight. <P>Still, when it came time to begin recording her follow-up, the aptly titled Epiphany, she realized the need to challenge herself. ""I felt like I was a little too shy and laidback my first time out,"" confesses Chrisette. ""On my new project I wanted to raise the bar and step-out of my comfort zone. I wanted to make songs that were more edgy, youthful and urban.<P>Recruiting talented collaborators that include Ne-Yo, the singer/songwriter has infused her jazz vocal style with more pop.

Yet, as can clearly be heard on her newest single ""Epiphany (I\'m Leaving),"" the 26-year-old has expanded her musical palette. <P>Constructed by Ne-Yo and Chuck Harmony, the title-track is a beautiful broken-hearted song that reveals the emotional misery behind Chrisette\'s lovely smile. ""Ne-Yo took out time from his crazy schedule to talk about direction for some of the songs, including the pain of break-ups and the joys of new love,"" says Chrisette.<P>Opening with spacey keyboards and girl group backgrounds, Chrisette\'s bold declaration of fly girl independence (""It\'s over,"" she sings) on ""Epiphany (I\'m Leaving)"" sets the tone of most of the disc. ""That word `epiphany\' just meant so much to me, because it was during the time that I was preparing to record that something clicked in my spirit."" Chrisette\'s coming back much tougher! Nowhere does that toughness come across more than on the soulful ""Blame It on Me."" An awesome ballad that colors itself with a little Muscle Shoals soul, there is red dirt earthiness that is just completely raw. ""You can say whatever you want, as long as its goodbye,"" Chrisette wails coldly. <P>That song is an amazing collaboration with Claude Kelly and Chrisette\'s writing with Chuck Harmony producing. A producer/ songwriter who is part of Ne-Yo\'s production collective Compound Entertainment, Chuck has worked on projects with Mary J. Blige, Janet Jackson and Celine Dion.<P>Since the release of her I Am, Chrisette has always toured endlessly with her band: the Truth and other R&B singers, Raheem DeVaughn, and Solange Knowles. ""To me, nothing is more important than touring,"" she says. ""Communicating with the audience through song can be magical. Singing in the studio is one thing, but you must be able to bring it to the stage too."" <P>Citing Japan and Barbados as two of her favorite spots, Chrisette explains, ""In Japan, it is just about the music, and an artist is judged by the material, not the latest gossip. While, in Barbados audiences just show such a passion, like they can pick-up what is going on in your heart."" In addition, Chrisette also found time to record with The Roots (""Rising Up"") and The Game (""Let Us Live""). <P>""Honestly, I was anxious when I went to work with Game, but he turned out to be one of the nicest people I\'ve ever met, and now he calls me `cuz\'"" Chrisette admits.<P>As if that was not enough, Chrisette also started working on her acting chops after appearing on an episode of Girlfriends. Playing herself in &#34;What\'s Black-A-Lacking,&#34; an episode directed by series star Tracee Ellis Ross, she says, ""That experience was amazing, because they allowed me to have so much input and let me to write my own scenes. Truthfully, there is no feeling like seeing myself on TV."" Ne-Yo and Harmony were inspired to write ""Another One."" Opening with a lovely acoustic guitar and Chrisette singing quietly, ""Another One"" slowly builds to the point of explosion. ""That is my favorite song on the album,"" Chrisette admits. Mixing rock guitars with hip-hop drum patterns, the track is an obvious winner. ""Nobody captures New American music like Ne-Yo and the Compound crew.""<P>Chrisette Michele worked with Rodney jerkins on the first album. ""Anybody who thinks they can go into the studio with Rodney and not work is kidding themselves,"" she laughs. <P>While angst and heartbreak is part of Chrisette Michele\'s persona on her sophomore project, the power and strength of her material gives Epiphany the sound of a future classic.

Boyle caught the judges (and the world) off guard with her masterful rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' from the musical Les Misrables. Within hours of her appearance on the show, Boyle was not only an internet sensation; she was a world-wide phenomenon. This is the musical story of the year!"", '', 'January 21st 2009 is not a date that Susan Boyle is ever likely to forget. &lsquo;I will never forget it,&rsquo; she clarifies, in her unmistakeably Celtic brogue. It was the day that the shy, devout 48 year old stepped onto the stage of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow for an audition on Britain&rsquo;s Got Talent. Or to put it another way, the day her world turned 360 degrees on its head. In front of the three-strong panel of judges charged with divining which of this year&rsquo;s British hopefuls really did have talent, the singing voice of Susan Boyle turned out to be a watershed moment neither she nor anyone involved in the show could possibly have foreseen. It is now both her and the show&rsquo;s defining moment.', 'In her own haphazard fashion, during three and a half minutes of television airtime, later aired to slack-jawed intakes of breath in May of this year, Susan Boyle fashioned a new kind of fame. She elicited a moment of pure, molten zeitgeist. She broke every rule of the talent show book and tore up a considerable number of the pages of popular music marketing into the bargain. She symbolized an astonishing variety of the little-people&rsquo;s revenge, quite by accident. Ms Boyle describes her own astonishing 2009 in refreshingly frank and simple terms. &lsquo;All I did was to apply for a talent show. I was lucky enough to be chosen. That&rsquo;s it in a nutshell.&rsquo; But something deeper was going on in the collective public consciousness. If the two watchwords of the 21st century have been &lsquo;reality&rsquo; and &lsquo;celebrity&rsquo;, Susan Boyle had accidentally located a brand new point on the graph where they both intersected. One of Britain&rsquo;s forgotten characters had rarely, if ever, been so memorable.', 'After her one audition for Britain&rsquo;s Got Talent, in which she confounded the judges, the audience and then anyone with access to Youtube&rsquo;s expectations by dazzling her way through a version of the song I Dreamed A Dream, from the musical Les Miserables, a tornado of opinionated column inches, speculation, rumination and conjecture around Susan Boyle grew feverishly. 300 Million You Tube hits and counting. She became the subject of op-ed newspaper columns, a front cover sensation in her own right. This unlikely candidate for the melting pot of the new star machine in 21st century Britain caused computer crashes, miles of newsprint and the sophisticated approval of Hollywood&rsquo;s well-heeled and super-groomed A-list. Though the content differed wildly, everyone proffering their thoughts on the self-confessed &lsquo;wee wifey&rsquo; seemed agreed on one point. That in 2009, to be free of an opinion on Susan Boyle was to be free of opinion itself.', 'For one brief moment, vanity itself collapsed. As that ancient old maxim &ndash; &lsquo;Never judge a book by its cover&rsquo; &ndash; clanked around the globe with speedy viral intensity, it was as if the world was about to offer its first unspoken apology for prizing beauty above all else. Perhaps it would temporarily forget its grotesquely accentuated new heights of judgement. Or perhaps Susan Boyle was just a fleeting icon by which a microscope was shone on our more fickle presumptions. Whatever history gifts the Susan Boyle story in the long term, it is now her time to prove that there is more to this incredible woman than being the symbol for a moment of international reflection. She will do it in the exact same way she entered our consciousness in the first place. With the raw combination of strength and fragility, beauty and solitude that is her singing voice.', 'In some ways, Ms Boyle&rsquo;s story is just the same as any woman with a voice in any choir up and down the UK. In her home town of Blackburn, she had been schooled in singing in churches and choral societies. She says now that, as a shy young woman with some learning difficulties, being hidden in the blanket of a collective singing arrangement offered her comfort. So in one other, crucial way, her story is entirely her own. The most unlikely chorister in the sea of voices stepped out of line and put her head above the parapet to be noticed. For Susan Boyle, though she would never deign to say so much herself, this was an act of personal heroism, the like of which she had never contemplated before.', 'The speed with which reaction to her performance picked up gravitas proved an incendiary media hotbed. But it was most surprising for the woman at the centre of it. &lsquo;It started off with the [Scottish newspaper] Daily Record visiting my door. And it ended up with TV stations from all over the world camping out on my street waiting for interviews and stories. I&rsquo;d peak behind the curtains in the house, saying &lsquo;what in God&rsquo;s name is going on here?&rsquo; Then the phone calls started. My number was still in the book at that particular time, so anybody could get it and the phone was ringing 24 hours a day. It was constant. People were ringing me who I couldn&rsquo;t understand because of their accents. All sorts of nationalities. Lots of Americans. It was absolutely unbelievable if I&rsquo;m being honest.&rsquo; She is self-deprecating about why she should have caused such a furore. &lsquo;A woman who went on with mad hair, bushy eyebrows and the frock I was wearing had to be noticed. Come on!&rsquo;', 'Such is the quick nature of today&rsquo;s star system, in September, just four months after her TV debut, Susan Boyle made her live TV comeback. She performed a rarefied take on The Rolling Stones Wild Horses, re-orchestrated to gently clasp the exact timbre of her natural talent, on the show&rsquo;s US cousin, America&rsquo;s Got Talent. An unprompted standing ovation followed. Outside of the unruly cyclone of her fame, there is something within the voice of Susan Boyle that is absolutely perfect for our times. At a moment when Dame Vera Lynn and Barbra Streisand are topping the album charts, there is something peculiarly modern about her improbably status as holding the international record for most pre-ordered album of all time. As the dust settles on the sheer wattage of conversation that she has prompted, it is time &ndash; as they say &ndash; to face the music.', 'Ms Boyle&rsquo;s debut album was put together during the summer of this year. She first entered a recording studio in July in Edinburgh, to test how her vocals would respond to tape. The results shocked both her and veteran producer Steve Mac. Decamping to London, she fashioned the record over two months, picking songs that resonated with her, that pricked something within that she felt ready to unleash through music. &lsquo;It was important that I could feel everything I was singing,&rsquo; she says, cutting straight to the core of why music can be such a useful release, an escape valve from the everyday.', 'A disarming mix of the sacred (&lsquo;My faith is my backbone,&rsquo; she says) and the secular, there is not a moment on it that is not moving. It is pitched exactly within the framework of the year she has enjoyed and, at well-documented times, endured. It is a collection of covers and original material that cuts a swathe into the interior life of the woman who is arguably the most intriguing, not to mention instantly recognisable character yet to be produced by the reality talent medium, the decade&rsquo;s defining TV genre.', 'When she hurts, it hurts. Her rousing rendition of Madonna&rsquo;s You&rsquo;ll See is a riposte to the children that picked on her in the playground. The new composition Who I Was Born To Be is an astonishing testament to self-belief against some startling odds. Yet when she dreams, we dream too. Because of her uncanny knack of picking a song so perfect for her tale at that very first audition, Ms Boyle has become synonymous with the word &lsquo;dream&rsquo;. Her flawless album rendition of I Dreamed A Dream may come as no surprise, but it still manages to pick every individual hair from the back of your neck and yank them to attention. A country ballad version of Daydream Believer delicately seals the deal of her being synonymous with the concept of dreaming.', 'For this is Susan Boyle&rsquo;s tale. The fearlessness to dream about something other than the lot life has handed you. The chance to escape. The pivotal role of music as a conduit to go to another place, sometimes lodged at the outer recesses of your imagination, and to allow that new place to blossom. Yes, this is Susan Boyle&rsquo;s tale. It is why it connected with so many unsuspecting people across the world. In another nutshell? If she can dare to dream, so can you.', 'SUSANS DEBUT ALBUM &ldquo;I DREAMED A DREAM&rdquo; IS RELEASED IN THE UK/WORLDWIDE ON NOVEMBER 23RD', '&ldquo;I Dreamed a Dream&rsquo; is already the most pre-ordered album worldwide of all time.']"

The ten new songs on <i>Locked Down</i>, written by Dr. John with Auerbach and a handpicked crew of backing musicians, combine incantatory chants (&#34;Ellegua&#34;) and often politically charged raps (&#34;Revolution&#34;) with candid and soulful reflections (&#34;My Children, My Angels&#34;), swaggering R&B (&#34;Big Shot&#34;), and a healthy dose of hypnotic, simmering funk (&#34;The King Of Izness&#34;). As with much of what this multiple Grammy-award winning singer and composer has recorded over the last five decades, the Big Easy is the musical and spiritual jumping-off point, but these new tracks incorporate a world's worth of influences, from gospel and blues to psychedelic rock and Afro-beat.<br><br>Auerbach had reached out to the iconic pianist, composer and singer better known to friends and fans as Mac Rebennack in 2010, offering to produce &#34;the best record you've made in a long time.&#34; After performing with Rebennack at the 2011 Bonnaroo Music Festival, Auerbach made good on that promise. The instrumental tracks for <i>Locked Down</i> were recorded at Auerbach's new Easy Eye Sound in Nashville and took shape during nine days of intense free-form sessions with the band Auerbach had originally assembled for Bonnaroo. Rebennack later returned on his own, with pages of lyrics, poems and ideas, to complete these songs. As Auerbach recounts, &#34;Watching him come up with parts was just so awesome. Mac is fearless, Like that Farfisa solo on &#34;Revolution&#34; -- that's a first-take solo. He just goes for it, man. And he killed it.&#34; Though Rebennack is sought after by countless jazz, R&B and rock artists for his piano playing, Auerbach kept him away from the instrument while encouraging him to experiment with other keyboards. &#34;I wanted to keep him a bit more edgy. I didn't want him to be outright retro in any way. And keeping him off the piano sort of helped. A lot of the music I played for Mac, when I went and visited him before the sessions, really perked up his ears - the really oddball stuff like the Ethiopian funk where the keyboardist is playing a Farfisa, those kind of good weird keyboard sounds.&#34;<br><br>With Auerbach's help, Rebennack recently featured on HBO's <i>Treme</i>, playing himself is poised to reclaim his position as master of the melting-pot Louisianan music style he pioneered in the late sixties under the guise of Dr. John, the Night Tripper. Funky, mysterious, downright mystical albums like <i>Gris Gris</i> and <i>Babylon</i> deeply influenced such artists as Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones, who invited Rebennack to play on their infamous <i>Exile On Main Street</i> sessions, and this work has, arguably, altered the course of rock and roll. Auerbach's mission was &#34;to bring back an awareness of him. I don't think he gets enough of the credit he deserves. After meeting him and talking to him and seeing the kind of stuff he was into, I knew that was still there, that person, that fire. He really was spiritual and cosmic but very much into conspiracy theory, politics. He had all the right things in his mind and I just knew I could get him to speak that language again.&#34;""]"

The libretto, though written in Sanskrit, is often mistakable, sonorously, for Italian. <i>Satyagraha</i>'s relative independence from the internecine Indian raga-like patterns of the composer's other long-form work is particularly ironic given the opera's subject: Mahatma Ghandi, whose native country's ritual culture and spiritual heritage have long informed Glass's music. This is no dramatic biography; following a mythological gambit, the scenes focus on a handful of specific events in Ghandi's long life (the construction of a communal farm, his tumultuous arrival in Durban, the publication of the weekly broadside <i>Indian Opinion</i>). Pointedly, the opera is an international affair, each of its three acts referencing a major cultural figure: Leo Tolstoy, Rabindranath Tagore, and Martin Luther King Jr. The music is most interesting when Glass draws parallels between his patented, minimalist patterns and standard classical mode. <I>--Marc Weidenbaum</I>""]"

Nastos With Wynton Marsalis, exuberance, energy and high-level musicianship is never an issue, but long-windedness can be. This may be one of the best of the trumpeter&apos;s mid-sized ensembles, a septet, with pianist Marcus Roberts, trombonist Wycliffe Gordon, saxophonists Wessell Anderson and Todd Williams, bassist Reginald Veal, and drummer Herlin Riley. It is also to the credit of Marsalis that he allows solid group interplay, and much room for his sidemen to not only stretch, but to also include their written works in the repertoire. The problem is for the listener, as the bulk of this material lays in long form, and is more a test for the band&apos;s stamina than the pleasure of the beholder. It works in concert, but not on the radio or at home. The 37-plus-minute title track, a grandiose treatise on bittersweet romance, is the most egregious with lengthy solos, tight but verbose ensemble sections, up-and-down dynamics, and rhythmic variations. &quot;The Jubilee Suite&quot; is only 12 minutes, and much more concise, echoing anthemic clarion calls, a hip modern New Orleans groove, and features for the clarinet of Williams and Marsalis. &quot;And the Band Played On&quot; is a processional march, and &quot;Brother Veal&quot; exudes a warm feeling marinated in easy swing, with the clarinet of Williams again a focal point. The last piece, &quot;Sometimes It Goes Like That,&quot; is the most complex melody, using the typical variable tempo and melodic devices that make a Marsalis jazz tune fairly recognizable. The cover art and title might indicate this was a blue interlude in the personal life of Marsalis translated into music and words on the indulgent &quot;Monologue&quot; prelude to the title cut and self-consciously rendered. It&apos;s fine music, but not particularly unique or original. Show Less Product Details Release Date: 5/19/1992 Label: Sony', ""Wynton Marsalis had already shed the strictures of the early influences on his playing, and proven he could write extended conceptual pieces, on his early masterpiece, <I>The Majesty of the Blues</I>, by the time of this 1992 release. <I>Blue Interlude</i> still represented a quantum leap for the fast-evolving composer and trumpeter. Like the jazz master who'd become his greatest inspiration, Duke Ellington, Marsalis was writing with his whole septet in mind at this point, prefiguring the epic effort of <I>Blood on the Fields</I>. The nearly 40-minute long title track ranges from traditional New Orleans jazz through gutbucket blues and Ellingtonia into bop and beyond without ever losing its digressive thread. Reed player Todd Williams also weighs in with a serious compositon, &quot;The Jubilee Suite.&quot; <i>--John Swenson</i>""]"

Baaba Maal has become famous as one of the great popularizers of Senegalese music, with big productions and illustrious stars peppering his records. But <i>Baayo</i> was a major change, as he dug deep into the roots of the music and came out with a deeply moving, sonically gorgeous acoustic recording. The interplay of the guitar between Maal and longtime compatriot Mansour Seck is rich and clear. Other acoustic strings and percussion lend it warmth and depth, and a very light touch on the synthesizers enhances a few tracks by remaining almost unnoticeable. Not since the now historic <i>Djam Leelii</i> (a set of guitar duets with Mansour Seck in the early \'80s) had Maal reached as deep into the well of time for inspiration. For the traditionalist this is Maal\'s essential album; for his longtime fans, this is the revelation of the music\'s long history. <i>--Louis Gibson</i>']"

Records of this razor-sharp bite and rapid brilliance are usually crafted in Germany or Sweden, it seems, but Dali's Dilemma manages to capture the essence of Yngwie Malmsteen, Rainbow, and Deep Purple, swirling it all together with progressive metal flourishes. The band is built around a solid songwriting ethic. The two brothers, guitarist Patrick and bassist Steve Reyes, met keyboardist Matt Guillory in '94, soon adding vocalist Matt Bradley and drummer Jeremy Colson to create the synergy that is this astonishingly capable prog metal maelstrom. Guillory is the band's resident rock veteran, having appeared on approximately 10 records for various artists, as well as Magna Carta's Rush tribute, the Pink Floyd tribute and the recent Magna Carta collaborative piece The Age Of Impact from The Explorers Club. The band's strange name came about rather rapidly (as does everything with this band). Matt's uncle suggested 'Dali's Dilemma' just as the boys had to abandon, for legal reasons, their former moniker. We needed a name really fast because Magna Carta wanted to start doing promotion, Matt recalls with a laugh. To us, Salvador Dali was an excellent painter, a surrealist, always very experimental, unconstrained by boundaries, which ties into the type of music we're playing. We try to create without limits and come across as really expressive. The 'Dilemma' part refers more to the challenge of doing something this experimental and becoming commercially accepted. I'm sure Dali was quite appreciated but it seems he had more of a cult following, just like progressive rock and its offshoots within metal. But for all the band's amazing musicianship, there is a discernible and distinguished hard rock current flowing beneath the mayhem. This is entirely intentional, and when pressed for influences, Matt cites the classics: old Metallica, old Rush and Pantera. On the lighter side, U2 is cited for their spiritualism and trademark sound, which can be heard on stirring ballad 'Hills Of Memory', a track underscored by a particularly Bono-esque vocal from Matt Bradley, who elsewhere evokes the passion and magnificence of a Jeff Scott Soto or a Glenn Hughes. But make no mistake, this one's jammed full of riffs and Yngwie-inspired axe acrobatics, as evidenced by the large and looming first and last tracks on the album, entitled 'Within A Stare' and 'Living In Fear' respectively. Matt agrees: I guess if you had to describe our music it would be very technical, very ambient; it runs the gamut. There's a wide range of styles which we all enjoy, but these two songs really hit home what we're all about: the heaviness, the progressive influence and the emotion. Lyrically, Dali's Dilemma is also strong and versatile. In fact, Steve, Matt and Jeremy contributed solo-credited lyrics, and Patrick turned in a collaboration with Jeremy. Songs are derived from very personal sources and are not only rendered oblique enough that they can often relate directly to experiences we all have in common, but also to intense, otherworldly or fantasy realms. A rare occasion where that platitudinous they're open to whatever interpretation someone wants to put on it actually applies. It's all very personal but we try to make it poetic, Matt offers with a dismissive wave of the hand.""]"

Better known as Ms. Badu\'s favorite backup vocalist, N\'Dambi is destined to become one of the brightest stars in today\'s burgeoning neo-soul movement. The Dallas-based artist\'s debut creation, <I>Little Lost Girl Blues</I>, was self-released under the auspices of N\'Dambi\'s own Cheeky-I Productions. It\'s a well-crafted gem that deserves a much larger audience than its limited distribution has cultivated. The album opens with the spoken-word mood composition ""Picture This,"" and from there journeys into explorations of scat-laced jazz (""The Meeting""), textured soul (""Can This Be Love""), and lushly retro R&B (""What\'s Wrong With You""). The album\'s signature piece is the achingly beautiful ""Sunshine,"" which pairs the artist\'s straightforward vocals with a spare acoustic guitar line.

But once you get past the fact that players dubbed Zoot Horn Rollo and the Mascara Snake were backing a headstrong fellow howling with ungodly range songs with names such as ""Old Fart at Play,"" ""My Head is My Only House Unless it Rains,"" and ""Nowadays a Woman\'s Gotta Hit a Man,"" you\'re confronted with...well, genius. The man born Don Van Vliet possessed a potent vision and the will to bring it to life on his own terms. This long-overdue two-disc retrospective presents 30 Beefheart tracks cut between 1966 and 1982 (when the Captain stepped away from the music world for the last time), including a smattering of rarities.

Keita's personal and musical history is long and fascinating. Born a visually impaired albino, he is descended from a great warrior king of the Manding Empire and risked familial disgrace by becoming a musician, a job traditionally seen as for the lower classes. After achieving some success with West African bands like Les Ambassadeurs, Keita moved toward a harder-rock sound tempered by his glorious soaring tenor voice. Produced by the legendary Ibrahima Sylla, <b>Soro</b> broke new ground by blending the traditional griot music of Mali with Euro-Pop sounds and top-flight Western production. The track <i>Wamba</i> burns hot with a funky big-band sound that uses a synthesizer to keep the beat and a choir of earthy back-up singers to keep it real. The title track <i>Soro</i> also gets the heavy synth treatment, but a chorus of handclaps and Keita's vocal make this track the most moving and effective. The album's explosive energy paired with Keita's vocal sound and phrasing results in a remarkable album."", ""Salif Keita's success story reads like an improbable historical novel. Although he was famous in Africa and had achieved a strong fan base among connoisseurs around the world, <b>Soro</b> was his international breakthrough album. The project was produced by Ibrahima Sylla, a visionary who had already discovered dozens of African stars and would later become the driving force behind Africando. The arrangements featured the roiling rhythms, slightly nasal female backup choirs, and traditional percussion typical of Malian music. But these were nearly overwhelmed by attack-trained brass charts, rocked-out electric guitars, overtly synthetic keyboards, and programmed drums. In retrospect, only a voice as powerful as Keita's could have not only managed to cut through the din but make an ally of it. <b>Soro</b> preserves the Golden Voice of Mali at an absolute peak of perfection, alternately soaring, laser-like, or caressing. Although this melting pot only narrowly avoids boiling over, it must be placed near the top of any list of the master's most influential albums. --Christina Roden, AllMusic.com""]"

Rather than change with each album, the band continues to explore the sonic territory between hush and bang with ever-increasing whimsy, innovation, and reverence. Evoking great drama in the confluence of opposites: silence and noise, entropy and melody, they sometimes manage to be everything at once. Even the interplay between Rick Rizzo\'s hushed, intimate whisper and Janet Beveridge Bean\'s resonant croon, which dips and soars with a cellist\'s proficiency, manages to be both dialogue and argument. In the hands of anyone else, ""Valrico74"" would be just a quiet little ditty, but Eleventh Dream Day create a jumbled collage built from scraps of Bean\'s haunting melody, a plunked random piano, a subtle surf of feedback, and just a bit of the guitar freak-out that Bean\'s husband, Rizzo, excels at (he sounds a bit like <a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/40611/${0}"">Neil Young</a> channeling outer-space feedback). The result is beautiful but vaguely unsettling. ""Ice Storm"" is vintage Eleventh Dream Day, with a chilling guitar squall and thumping backbeat. ""Way Too Early on Sunday Morning"" may be the best thing they\'ve ever recorded, a song that wavers with a hangover\'s intensity, gradually building toward an uncomfortable crisis then easing into a sunny denouement.

On June 23, 1990, this extraordinary group performed two concerts at the Mellon Jazz Festival at the Philadelphia Academy of music. Both shows were filmed and have been carefully edited to create a technically flawless video of a truly ""once in a lifetime"" event. All of the songs were selected with great care, as might be expected from a band of this caliber. Including ""Shadow Dance"", a Dave Holland original; ""Solar"", a popular Miles Davis original; ""Blue"" is an original piece by Jack DeJohnette, and ""Cantaloupe Island"", the closing number of the program, is a Herbie Hancock original from the 60\'s. Formatted for DVD 16 x 9.', '<I>DeJohnette, Hancock, Holland, Metheny in Concert</I> is a feature-length (98 minutes) release edited from two concerts given by the jazz superstar lineup of Jack DeJohnette, Herbie Hancock, Dave Holland, and Pat Metheny at the Mellon Jazz Festival held in the Academy of Music in Philadelphia on June 23, 1990. This was part of an outstanding world tour following drummer DeJohnette\'s <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000001XM/${0}""><I>Parallel Realities</I> album</a>, though this program and the original album have only two cuts in common, ""Indigo Dreamscapes"" and ""Nine over Reggae."" Hancock (piano and keyboards) and Metheny (guitar) were both on <I>Parallel Realities</I>, but here they contribute material from their own back catalog: Hancock a barnstorming 15-minute ""Hurricane"" and the closing ""Cantaloupe Island,"" Metheny the appropriately nocturnal and reflective ""The Bat."" Bassist Dave Holland, who was the guest on the tour, wrote the longest cut, ""Shadow Dance."" Here are four of the world\'s finest modern jazz artists at the top of their game; virtuoso playing certainly, but also impeccable taste and artistry, seamless interaction, and inspired music-making. When combined with a transparent, gimmick-free visual style, which simply shows the musicians playing (concentrated on whoever is soloing), the result is an uplifting, exhilarating example of how well jazz can be presented on DVD. <I>--Gary S.

King, Eric Clapton, Dickie Betts and Duane Allman among others. In recording this CD Will has returned to his roots and wears his influences proudly on his sleeve. Special guests include Jerry Donahue, Steve Duncan, Ted Greene, John Jorgenson, Juke Logan and more!', 'Few guitar pickers can out-slide, out-bend or out-torture a Telecaster the way Will Ray can. As a member of the pyrotechnical twang trio The Hellecasters, Will has created a place for himself among some of the worlds guitar greats. <P> <P>A native of Richmond, Virginia, Will began his musical journey at the tender age of ten when his older siblings would play records of Peter Paul & Mary, Leadbelly, Ian and Sylvia, Elvis and Korner, Ray & Glover. Later on in high school, Will discovered the Beatles, the Blues Project, Cream, the Grateful Dead and Paul Butterfield Blues Band. When he turned sixteen he bought his first guitar and immediately started woodshedding on the licks of Mike Bloomfield, Eric Clapton, Danny Kalb and Keith Richards. <P>After a two year stint in the Army, during which he did a tour of Viet Nam, Will took a hiatus from guitar and went to college under the GI bill. On Christmas vacation of his sophomore year, his younger brother Enos brought home a copy of Live Dead by the Grateful Dead. Will would never be the same again. He picked up the guitar again and suddenly found what he wanted to do; play guitar! With Jerry Garcia as his new source of inspiration, Will started a routine of practicing eight full hours a day while still going to school. When he graduated he started playing in a string of local rock bands like Sneaky Weeds, Dry Ice, Mace, Abby & the Milkmen, and Saffron. Then a band named King Cotton asked him to join and Will was introduced to country rock. He began studying the styles of Roy Buchanan, James Burton, Clarence White and Danny Gatton. After being in a slew of other local bands Will joined his first straight ahead redneck country band, The Pacers. He loved it! He could finally play pedal steel licks all night long and walk away with something he never had before while playing rock - money! <P>By now Will began the first of what would become three day jobs working in a foundry. It was hard, dirty work but he felt like he was a true workin man just like in the country songs he played and sang in the bars at night. It was during this time that he also hooked up with two men who owned a fledgling recording studio outside Richmond called Common Bond Studios. It was at Common Bond that Will first learned the art of recording. He was down there a lot playing on demos, jingles and records. He also learned about song construction, arranging and producing. On weekends Will would go in and record his own songs when the studio wasnt too busy. At night he still continued to play in various country and blues bands including The Cold Harbor Band, Westwind and the Terry Brennon Band. After five years of working jobs by day and playing music at night, Will had had enough and in 1983 his new bride Gayle talked him into moving out west to Los Angeles where he could play music full time and she could pursue her art. <P>Making a living in Los Angeles was a challenge, but Will began finding work in nightclubs and eventually the studios. He was a member of several ground breaking 80s cow punk bands including Tin Star, Vanishing Breed, Candye Kane & the Armadillo Stampede, and Will Ray & the Gila Monsters. Utilizing his experience in studios, he began producing country-oriented artists in the LA area including three compilation albums, Hollywood Roundup, Detour West and Far West. It was on Hollywood Roundup that Will first recorded with soon-to-be Hellecaster henchmen Jerry Donahue and John Jorgenson. Will and fellow co-producer Glen Mont wanted to write an instrumental on the album featuring some of the top country pickers in Los Angeles. The result was Pickers Brawl and it featured John Jorgenson, Jerry Donahue, Jeff Ross, Billy Bremner and Will picking up a storm. It was the first time Jerry, John and Will ever recorded together, but it would not be the last. <P>Two years later at the legendary Palomino club, Will and Jerry Donahue were sipping on some brews durin']"

The toy piano of ""Anthem for Old Souls"" and loopy rhymes of ""Sneaky Jesus"" may also recall the Waits connection, but the goofily heartfelt lament of ""No Hep Cats"" and smoky jazz of ""Blood Alley"" argue that Weiss holds his distinctly American bohemian traditions, musical and otherwise, in high regard. As if to underscore the point, Weiss has included ""Down the Road Apiece,"" his 1970 duet with blues legend <a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/52462/${0}"">Willie Dixon</a>, a track that\'s perhaps the album\'s most jarringly normal.

This set (which shares it\'s title with other collections in the same series) is a portrait of the vibraphonist\'s working bands during that era. The material was chosen by Burton, and his liner notes follow the history with concise insights. With the exception of his duets with Chick Corea (not represented here, but their ""Crystal Silence"" is a key work in the discographies of both men) and Ralph Towner, Burton was truly a band player and leader throughout the entirety of his career. Perhaps recognizing the specific timbres of his instrument, Burton has always sought appropriate settings to showcase it\'s sound and gently expand it\'s possibilities. Writing only rarely, Burton found material from the members of his band as well as a couple key outsiders, Carla Bley and Michael Gibbs.', 'Gary Burton\'s selection for ECM\'s <I>rarum</I> series anthologizes nine selections he recorded for the company between 1972 and 1987. Burton chose them himself (he also contributes an incisive and stylish essay surveying the music and the bands represented), and the result is an absorbing, wide-ranging portrait of his middle years, by the end of which he was well on the way to being the only vibist to seriously rival Milt Jackson. Amongst others he is joined by bassists <a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/78397/${0}"">Eberhard Weber</a> and <a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/78424/${0}"">Steve Swallow</a>, guitarists Mick Goodrick and <a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/45226/${0}"">Pat Metheny</a>, and pianist <a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/97150/${0}"">Makoto Ozone</a>--that last foreshadowing more recent collaborations--and the performances are in keeping with the musicians\' heavyweight reputations.

In Equilibrium , he continues to challenge the limits and preconceptions of jazz with this explosive, beats-driven modern jazz recording.</br><br><br>the band:<br>Bassist William Parker takes the cue form Nu Bop and delivers some of his most stylistic playing yet. Drummer-extraordinaire Gerald Cleaver lays down delicious beats over Chris Flam s lucid/liquid synth programming, and vibes-man Khan Jamal creates warm, rich resonating tones - all this sewn seamlessly together through Matthew s unmistakably unique piano styling...</br><br><br>in matt s own words:<br> My new and fourth Blue Series record Equilibrium is a synthesis of what I've learned from all my other Blue Series albums. We are continuing to move into the future, exploring beat elements with modern jazz. But, I am also bringing to bear on this project, the goals I had on New Orbit of developing a jazz ambient music and my original goals on Pastoral Composure of exploring the elasticity of the jazz language when straight ahead jazz elements morph organically into more modern forms. </br>"", 'Delaware-born pianist Matthew Shipp has a rare gift for taking the jazz traditions of the past and translating them into the aural lingua franca of today\'s popular idioms. On this CD, his fourth in his label\'s so-called Blue Series, Shipp, along with bassist William Parker, drummer Gerald Cleaver, vibraphonist Khan Jamal, and synth-programmer Flam, brilliantly melds the aural imagery of <a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/76012/${0}"">Andrew Hill</a>\'s \'60s Blue Note classic <I>Judgment!</I> with contemporary electronica effects.

That floating kind of dreamtime is aurally illustrated on the title track, ""Nebula Theory,"" and ""Nu Matrix."" The byte-size backbeats on ""Vamp to Vibe"" and ""The Root"" never get in the way of the swing, and ""The Key,"" the most ""straight-ahead"" tune on the CD, reveals the logic and lyricism of Shipp\'s improvisations. This recording offers a recipe for jazz-based music that speaks to our times. ""We are continuing to move into the future, exploring beat elements with modern jazz,"" Shipp writes in the liner notes. ""Ultimately, the goal of this album is to take your mind on a trip."" <I>--Eugene Holley Jr.</I>']"

The trouble is his arrangements are virtually interchangeable. On all 10 of these songs Belfour\'s guitar repeats same-sounding sliding notes and arpeggios over the single-chord drone that defines the blues of his native North Mississippi. There\'s no slide, few variations in his patterns, and--despite primal drumming on some tracks--little change in tempos throughout the entire album.

Their sophomore release is bolstered considerably by the new rhythm section of Paul Bostaph (ex-<a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/56239/${0}"">Slayer</a>) and bassist Johnny Bechtel, who provide a solid, propulsive groove that allow the songs of guitarist/vocalist Tim Narducci and lead guitarist Adam Ruppel to explore a landscape that\'s as melodic as it is driving and often texturally compelling.

Still, Narducci and Ruppel deserve credit for anchoring their agro-metal angst--the grinding grooves of ""Shine"" and ""Infected,"" dark-emo rumblings of ""Leaving Only Scars"" and the shadowy, hypnotic respite of ""Right Before You""--in honest musical frameworks instead of cheap attitude and production affectations. Sophomore albums are notoriously problematic, but this one\'s shortcomings seem minor in the scope of things and may form the foundation for greater things to come. <I>--Jerry McCulley</I>']"

Thanks to die-hard lyricists like Nas and Eminem, hip-hop has finally started to move out of the superficial thrill of material excess and more towards an elevated position of lyrical enlightenment. Although he never surrendered his poetic authenticity, Killah Priest couldn\'t have picked a better time to present his spiritually minded fourth album, Black August. In an effort to cleanse rap\'s tainted state, the Brooklyn rapper (born Walter Reed) has created a solid collection of beats, rhymes, and life that not only showcases his dedication to the art of MCing, but also introduces a fresh crop of producers whose rich soundscapes stand strong behind Killah Priest\'s dense scripture. <P>""I know Black August\'s going to inspire rappers to step up their game,"" assures the Wu-Tang affiliate of his most cohesive audio collection to date. ""I think it\'s time for real artists to come out and put their heart back into it."" Ever since Killah Priest was introduced to hip-hop heads in 1997 on the poignant track, ""B.I.B.L.E."" from his rhyme mentor GZA\'s legendary Liquid Swords, Priest has flexed his poetic license to fantastic results. He was also a key collaborator on the horror-core cult classic albums Six Feet Deep and The Pick, The Sickle, and The shovel by the Gravediggers which gave Priest the opportunity to form the holy-core collective Sons of Man. <P>But it was Killah Priest\'s run with the Wu-Tang Clan that gave him the proper studio training and worldwide exposure he needed to become a bona fide solo artist. In 1998, after touring the continental U.S. and Europe extensively with the Shaolin masters, Priest released his debut, Heavy Mental on Geffen Records to critical acclaim. He followed with two more solo offerings, 2000\'s View From Masada (MCA), and his independently released Priesthood (Proverbs) both of which were embraced by fans and critics alike. <P>Today, Killah Priest has his sights set on shaking up the rap game\'s current events. ""I\'ve been put in the dark so long this is my time to come out and brighten up the rap game,"" explains Priest. ""Black August is a phenomenon, it\'s not a gimmick. It\'s my heart spilled out on paper."" When it comes to lyrics, few can express the trials and tribulations of the daily grind like Priest can. On the innovative stylings of ""When I\'m Writing"", Killah breaks down his personal form of psychotherapy into a series of mentally charged metaphors, ""I write rhymes like I\'m doing time/Listen, when I hit the pen I start doing a sentence/ I got the flow locked behind each bar."" Later on the conceptually driven ""Deja Vu"", Priest flips a dramatic storyline of a criminal trapped in a horrific turn of events. And ""Robbery"" perfectly exemplifies Priest\'s metaphoric vision as he uses an everyday heist to represent his aim to claim what is rightfully his. Pushing past what\'s expected of him, ""Rain"" finds Priest on the come-up, spitting with a Midwestern influenced bounce track alongside Main Flow. <P>With an arsenal of solid tracks and candid lyrics, Killah Priest is in the best shape of his life. With his freshly inked deal with Recon/Artemis, Priest is determined to make serious moves. ""It\'s about time I had the right promotion behind me. A real team of individuals, that\'s what this album is all about,"" declares Priest. ""That\'s why I called it Black August. It\'s gonna be a terror to some, but to others, it\'ll be a nice day."" With his steadfast devotion to enhancing hip-hop culture, Killah Priest is poised to break some new ground and give the game exactly what it\'s missing.']"

The Band has toured nationally and shared stages with the likes of Juliana Theory, Finch, Further Seems Forever as well as performing successfully on the Warped Tour and Cornerstone Festivals. When the bands debut record, Lost For Words came out on Seattle Indie, Rocketstar Records and quickly approached the 5000 sales mark, the industry at large began taking notice. When the band recorded a new 5 song demo with Aaron Sprinkle (MxPx, Poor Old Lu) this industry interest turned into serious courting by several major labels. After putting a professional management team in place to help determine the bands course of action, the band made the decision to release the Black Lines To Battlefields EP on The Militia Group who has been a long time friend and supporter of Acceptance. What the future holds for the band is made clear by simply listening to the CD or seeing the band live. Sincere, Sophisticated and lyrically driven modern rock that has an extraordinary ability to connect deep with fans of all types of rock, punk, and hardcore.', 'Kaylan Cloyd - guitar Nick Radovanovich - drums Christian McAlhaney - guitar Jason Vena - vocals Ryan Zwiefelhofer - bass <P>Forging their roots in the underground Seattle rock scene, ACCEPTANCE has made waves not only by delivering a truly loaded live show but through an intrinsic spark and creative sincerity that radiates from the music itself. <P>""A lot of bands challenge their audience and that9s always a good thing but what9s more important for us is to use our music to challenge ourselves and put our true character to the test -- to say what we think and be who we really are,"" vocalist Jason Vena says. ""We do hope this inspires our friends and fans of the band to do the same."" Growing up playing in local punk and hardcore bands has created a strong sense of honesty and self respect that serves as a foundation on which the ACCEPTANCE sound is built. <P>""The ideas for what we wanted to do musically were all there in our previous experiences,"" guitarist Kaylan Cloyd recalls. ""When we came together as ACCEPTANCE we quickly began to refine those sounds which lead us to where we are today."" Another big point of progress for the band is that no one is relegated to just their own instrument in the writing process. <P>""Everyone plays multiple instruments,"" guitarist Christian McAlhaney explains. ""Nick was on guitar before switching to drums and Jason, who sings, also played bass before we got Ryan in the band. Its never felt as complete as it does now."" After performing locally and releasing their debut CD through Seattle-based Rocketstar Records, ACCEPTANCE launched regional and national tours with bands like The Juliana Theory, Noise Ratchet and Further Seems Forever. The act also performed at the popular Cornerstone Festival in Illinois. The Militia Group - originally a booking agency -- approached the band and began a professional and personal relationship that continues to grow stronger every day. <P>""We are so happy to have seen ACCEPTANCE grow from this really cool hardworking bunch of kids into the professional rock machine that they have quickly become,"" comments Chad Pearson of The Militia Group (who eventually scrapped the booking business to focus on building the record label.) ""They have been such a solid part of the Militia family that it feels totally natural for us to be releasing the EP. We believe big things are coming for these guys -- they are all such good people."" <P>When asked to sum up the bands approach, Vena explains: ""Although music means the world to each member of the band, its important to us that people come away from our shows or from listening to our CD with something more than just a good song or a catchy lyric. We like knowing that we9ve made people think and feel something about themselves.""']"

While his vocal presence drifted from agitated to saddened, intimate to in your face, Staind\'s instrumentation was often average at best. All of which makes The String Quartet Tribute to Staind a surprise, since its instrumental arrangements of material from Dysfunction (1999) and Break the Cycle (2001) ring with emotional shifts and moments of real power. Guided by violin and viola, the mix also includes cello and double bass, but fails with forays into programming and synth that only work on the pleading ""Fade."" For the most part, however, the musicians have expertly transfused Lewis\' dualistic nature -- emotional train wreck to lumbering locomotive -- into their arrangements. ""Outside"" is fragile, yet it seems to teeter on the edge, as if it were a porcelain figurine about to crash to the floor below. The grinding ""Just Go"" is almost unrecognizable, reimagined as a halting ballad tinged with hopeful violins. In this case, the chamber musicians have actually made their source material better. The set is essential for any Staind fan, as it offers another window into the emotions making up the band\'s spiritual center. ~ Johnny Loftus, Rovi']"

The more experimental re-workings by Serj Tankian on ""Bird of Paradise (Gone)"" and Hal Willner\'s Whoops I\'m an Indian on ""Salt Peanuts (The Mr. Peanut Chronicles)"" just seem to be exercises in ego. The better contributions come in the form of Dan the Automator\'s take on ""Perhaps (Someday the Roof Will Get Fixed)"" and Me\'shell NdegOcello\'s interpretation of ""Relaxin\' at Camarillo (August 29),"" where Parker\'s original compositions are simply complemented by new grooves and beats.

For over a decade as a professional musician, hes witnessed the musical winds blow from alternative rock to gangster rap, and hes clutched his acoustic guitar tightly through the gale force of teen pop. Through it all, he has stayed the course, crafting timeless rock n roll in the tradition of the icons of American music. As a reflection of their author, Gregorys songs are permeated with the determination that has fueled his life and his music. His songwriting takes cues from the canon of distinctively American songwriters -- the blue-collar ranks that include luminaries from Hank Williams to Bruce Springsteen. Like those before him, Gregorys own history of determination is reflected in his work, an attribute that elevates his songs from pop music to the realm of inspiration. With its prevailing messages of perseverance and optimism, Gregorys Atlantic debut, ""PICTURES FROM HOME,"" is largely autobiographical. Tracks like ""Living Proof,"" ""Ride of Your Life,"" and ""Half of Me"" are tributes to self-resolve. The plaintive ""Victoria,"" a song partially inspired by the fear and helplessness that permeated the D.C. region during the 2002 sniper attacks, is about the hope that a good friend can provide. Gregorys been knocked down, but hes not too jaded to write about getting back up. Having written songs since he was a teenager, Gregory gigged with various Los Angeles local outfits for years before his band California drew industry attention in the late-90s. With the band falling apart and without a record deal, Gregory was woodshedding new songs in Nashville and L.A. when his manager placed a fortuitous call to Atlantic Records.<P> Gregory found a kindred spirit in producer Rob Jacobs, whose engineering and production credits include The Eagles, Alanis Morissette, and Elton John. ""We brought in Rob, and we hit it off,"" he recounts. ""He understood that the songs didnt really need a lot of production, a lot of schlock. I needed someone to find good tones and find the right players."" Even before completion of the album, the track ""Ride of Your Life"" became the single from the movie What A Girl Wants. He remembers back to his early days writing songs: ""I saw so many people that I used to play in bands withOne day they were in tight pants with big hair, and the next they were wearing shorts, combat boots, and flannels and bitching and moaning about how miserable they were. I just stayed my course."" He mentions Tom Petty and Billy Joel as songwriters whose music has transcended time and trends. ""I knew thats where my thing was,"" Gregory admits. It is that spirit, unquestionably one or rock n rolls primary tenets, that propels John Gregorys music. Its a celebration and return to what has always mattered most: a great song, a great voice, a great band, and the intangible that those things form together. Because thats something that will never go out of style.']"

Matthew Shipp playing is as wonderful as ever, dancing on the delicate line between melodic freedom and mechanical vigor; it is only with subtle little touches, like his slightly re-quanticised echo in stereo at the end of &#34;Get Your Hand off My Shoulder, Pig&#34;, that El-P tips his hand and the listener is left suddenly uncertain as to which parts, if any, of the recording are raw and undoctored.

But it\'s ultimately unclassifiable, skipping genres and seamlessly melding tradition and experimentation in music that upholds its folk roots while not being bound by them. Using ancient and little-heard traditional Polish instruments like the suka--a Polish fiddle from the 16th century--and the Polish dulcimer, the Warsaw Village Band crafts their own soundscapes, infusing folk tradition with a thoroughly modern attitude. ""Chassidic Dance,"" with its Jewish melodies and trip-hop slanted drumming, and the dirges ""At My Mother\'s"" and ""Clear Water"" achieve an organic fusion tinged with the psychedelic. Meanwhile, the group\'s lyrics amplify its contemporary leanings: ""Who Is Getting Married"" takes a feminist stance on marriage and ""Cranes"" sets an anarchistic protest song to bombastic rhythm. The group\'s mix of old and new styles is so complete in fact, that the last two songs on the album--dance floor-ready remixes by two Polish DJ\'s--are almost redundant, mixing electronic beats with Polish folk melodies in a manner not all that different from the organic remixing the Warsaw Village Band realizes throughout the whole album. <I>--Ezra Gale</I>']"

Originally released last year in the U.K. as <I><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000A0UB0/${0}"">Quixotic</a></I>, the American version is three songs shy, but no less powerful for it. --<I>John Diliberto</I>']"

It is formidable in size, length, volume, and visionary ambition. A devout Roman Catholic, Messiaen drew inspiration from the Church and its symbols, as well as from the sights and sounds of nature, especially the bird-songs that he loved and incorporated into his music. The 20 movements of this work are meant to illustrate different ways of contemplating the Nativity. They bear elaborate titles, which however do not seem to illuminate the music, at least for those unfamiliar with the religious background. But this does not really matter to the actual musical experience. The work's most pervasive characteristics are its obsessive repetitiousness, and, apart from a few soft, beautifully lyrical sections, its relentlessly high decibel level. The sustained intensity and aggressive ferociousness of the banging and crashing can be quite terrifying. Contrast is created through different textures, tempi, moods, and sudden short-lived drops in dynamics. Messiaen's genius found expression most arrestingly in his orchestration; he exploits, combines and contrasts instrumental colors and timbres with extraordinary mastery and imagination. Here, he almost succeeds in turning the piano into an orchestra, making it sing, speak, growl, clang, crash, and scream. Sometimes it seems to carry on a conversation between different registers or between contrapuntal, chordal, and call-and-response elements. The harmonic structure is fairly simple and essentially static. There are strong echoes of Debussy, of jazz, and of waltzes a la Richard Strauss. The performance is spectacular. Peter Serkin, long one of Messiaen's foremost interpreters, triumphs over all pianistic, sonic, intellectual and emotional demands. Piling sonority upon sonority, finding melodic voices in the huge chords and contrapuntal lines in the thick textures, he keeps even the slowest sections from sagging and turns the fast ones into powerful, scintillating cascades, leaving the listener dazzled and exhausted. <I>--Edith Eisler</I>""]"

As Lizz relates her own tales to the listener, you feel at once a part of the song and also realize that you havent heard anything like this with a voice so sultry and smooth. You might suspect this to be a Billie Holiday and A Tribe Called Quest collaboration but no, you just heard Lizz Fields debut album, which is to be released October 26, 2004 via ABB Soul, a division of ABB Records. The North American October release will feature four new compositions and remixes of favorites like ""I Gotta Go"" by DJ Spinna (Beyond Real Productions) and ""When I See Love"" by ColdFusion (G-Unit, Skillz, Musiq). The new songs will be added to crowd approved composures like ""Star Gazer,"" the bass heavy ""Hey,"" and favorites like ""Say the Word"" and ""Selfish Tendencies"". These twelve tracks will be new to most but, loved by all. <P>To begin to understand ByDayByNight, you should understand what Lizz Fields likes musically. ""I like big heavy beats, dark heavy bass. I like crazy ambient ethereal sounds. Sometimes I liken it to these crazy sounds you hear from Tricky, Bjork, or Portishead with hip-hop beats [but] at the same time I like it to be musical [with] changes that arent always expected,"" Lizz notes, ""I like minor chords and challenging music, music thats difficult to sing [like] Say the Word. That song is hard because I am the only one singing what I am singing. The melody I am singing, no one is playing that."" <P>But to truly understand her as an artist, you have to understand her position on being an artist. She envisions herself as a quintessential artist judged not on one mega hit but a body of work that improves and grows as she does as an artist perfecting her craft. Her music is an original blend of jazz over dark hip hop beats and has been capturing hearts, dollars, euros and yens with songs like ""I Gotta Go"", ""Selfish Tendencies"" and ""Say the Word"". Even as she brings forth these melodies and phrases, Fields smiles to herself because these songs that are selling are the same songs that established producers and record labels questioned and didnt think would take off when she sent them as her demo. <P>Before becoming the artist known as Lizz Fields, she had to first conquer her fear of singing and find her voice as the student, teacher, set designer and thespian known as Lizz Fields. She was a vocal major at the Philadelphia Creative & Performing Arts High School. Her soprano voice, which we know now to be strong, jazzy, and well controlled, was the same but in high school; she knew that her voice wasnt like the voice of the shining stars in her high school like Boys II Men or Amel Larrieux. She opted to become the charismatic individual that we see on stage - infectious, silly and honest. Fields knew she loved jazz; Duke Ellingtons Mood Indigo was her anthem. ""The song was real smooth and kind of sensual. I thought songs like that were cool. Why doesnt everybody sing like that? I never forgot the song, that was the Lizz song, but I sang it until I wrote my own songs"" Fields recalls. When she found her voice in the church choir it was an epiphany. Lizz made the song fit her but she had other struggles to conquer before she was ready to be who she is now. <P>The evolution from trepid singer to full-fledged artist wasnt as clear and paved a path as one might think. ByDayByNight began as a demo that was never intended to be an album. It was intended to showcase the singing and songwriting talent. It became an album when she realized that the patrons of her part time job liked, commented and asked if what they heard was for sale while she played her demo songs. Lizz Fields evolved into the independent artist when she began to sell her music and fans bought it locally, nationally and internationally 60 CDs here, 50 there, 20 over here, license to distribut', 'LIZZ FIELDS BIO <P>When who you are meets who you want to be, the occasion is sometimes unexpected. The journey to this point may elude you but when you think about it for a moment, it all seems perfectly clear. For Lizz Fields these are both true statements. Her own journey to becoming a singer/songwriter has been just that. On stage or in a living room on a sofa, Lizz Fields has an energy about her that is infectious. Most would say it is her girlish charm or down right silliness. Others would mix that with her sexiness or is it her sensuality? Regardless of either or and both, her smile does give much of her away but in the end it is her voice that makes you gasp. ByDayByNight is the title of the independent album by a very independent singer and songwriter by the name of Lizz Fields. It is also the process she took to become this person.']"

The first album garnered the radio and video hit &#34;Why Me&#34;, a year later Tony followed it up with the 2nd Plant P album (a double) &#34;Pink World&#34; which has been compared to Pink Floyds &#34;The Wall&#34; for its depth and intensity. <br><br>Tony has over 30 albums to his credit and as a multi-instrumentalist and vocalist has worked with some of the biggest names in the business. His searing Mini Moog work on the classic Rainbow album &#34;Rainbow Rising&#34; is legendary. <br><br>Now after 2 decades Tony has come back to Planet P Project and is once again breaking ground.<br><br>&#34;1931&#34; is the first record of a trilogy: &#34;Go Out Dancing&#34;, which will continue with &#34;Levittown&#34;, about the fifties, from drunken Joe McCarthy to the Birth of the Cool to the Kennedy Boys, and &#34;Out In The Rain&#34; which according to Tony, will be all he has to say about the disgraceful state of the world's unfortunates - which of course is just about everybody... &#34;1931&#34; itself deals with the radical right, starting in Weimar Germany in 1923, right through to the Federal Building and including all that fun bunch of nazis, including Tim McVeigh and the militia movement... racewar, indeed! Tony hopes he doesn't pull any punches. Viciously satirical, at times quite lyrical and melodic and at other times some Sick Shit. &#34;If you can SEE it, you're IN it - there's no line dividing the two&#34; is the main theme in this record. What they used to call civic responsibility.... or civil courage. The 2nd and 3rd G.O.D. records will follow as fast as Tony can make 'em. KEEP BELIEVING."", 'It s been several years since this former Rainbow Keyboardist decided to resurrect the name of his famed 80 s Planet P Project after years of simply going by Tony Carey for his musical endeavors. But continuing his prowess for elaborate projects, Carey has offered the first installment of a trilogy titled Go Out Dancing. Kind of a strange title when you think about what the concept of 1931 entails, so what was going on that year, what type of hell was going to be broken loose in Europe at the time, oh yeah, it s back to reality, no sci-fi themes here. <br><br>Musically the album is filled with drum loops, layered keyboards, and the balance of electronic pop and progressive rock and although the album is straightforward throughout, Carey does tend to move through different forms of songwriting ideas to add different textures to the record; for example, there is the darkened atmosphe within My Radio Talks to Me, the Europop tinged Join the Parade, the emotional balladry in Waiting for the Winter, and there are jumpy danceable tracks such as The Judge and the Jury and The Tings Never Told Me; it s not exactly the type of music you would expect from a storyline that entails both brainwashing and war. <br><br> 1931 is a return to his sound of his eighties solo work; but yet, there is no dated factor to it. 1931 is a record of solo musicianship proportions, where it is Carey s own musical personality that is front and center on this record. It s hard to tell where the next record will lead the dancing concept, but it will be interesting. --Ytsejam<br /><br />So when I bought this CD I was simply shaking with excitement. I mean I had felt Planet P Projects first two releases in the early 80 s (Self titled and Pink World) were really the direction I felt progressive rock music was going to take.<br><br>Unfortunately that was not to be the case and I had assumed that Tony Carey and the PPP concept had faded into the great ether of fantastic music lost on the whims and poor taste of the consuming public.<br><br>Fast forward to early 2005 and the new PPP 1931 lands in my music collection. 1931, as noted in the brief liner notes, is part I of a trilogy titled Go out Dancing . Part II, Levittown is under production and Part III; Out in the Rain is mostly written and should be in production in the not too distant future. But I am jumping ahead. This review is about the most excellent release 1931.<br><br>I suppose that 1931 is a way to look back at some of the deepest and darkest times in human kind. It starts off with the very haunting My Radio Talks to Me, which is set in both Detroit and Germany. People are rushing home to listen to their radio where some of the great leaders and murderers of our time talk to the people through the radio, no TV in 1931.<br><br>The listener is fed snippets of a Hitler speech, a snippet of a Hirohito speech and in general the stage is set for the beginnings of WWII.<br><br>Each song lays the ground work for not only the Holocaust but also for some modern day actions like racism here in the US, white supremacists in the wilds of Idaho (The Other Side of the Mountain), and the Oklahoma City bombing (The Judge and the Jury).<br><br>Tony Carey s song writing is just heart wrenching all across this CD and each song grabs you by the throat and pulls you deeply into the fray. Join the Parade points out how mob mentality works, how you can have a hate filled ideology and as long as you remain part of the crowd you can do your nasty deeds and simply fade into the background.<br><br><br><br> Good Little Soldiers says just follow along and do what you re told and I (insert name of leader/ruler/king) will set you free. Two songs, Work (will make you free) and Waiting for Winter are definitely about the Holocaust and just really make your heart hurt as we are again reminded of man s tremendous inhumanity toward man.<br><br>Tony Carey however brings this CD crashing into modern times with the last song Where Does it Go? which opens with a line implying that why should we worry about past atrocities, I mean it can t really happen again... now can it?<br><br>And we are left pondering the fact that we humans just don t get it, we don t get the fact that we have over and over and over again repeated the most horrendous acts of our past as we simply refuse to learn from the errors of our ways.<br><br>This is a very dark and moody CD but the tunes are at times toe tappers with great hooks and riffs. It simply does not sound like a one guy plays it all CD but of course this is a Tony Carey release.<br><br>If you have liked Tony s other works and especially if you have enjoyed the two previous PPP releases you will really love 1931. As a little hint, Tony is finally working on a follow-up to the critically acclaimed Pink World that was released in 1984. <br><br>Buy 1931 and pray that parts II and III are released soon. --Prog4You<br /><br />If you only knew how many times I listened to Planet P s Pink World what I m about to say won t come as a surprise. I never did get into the first Planet P LP but the second, Pink World was so full of great compositions, a great concept and a great sound that I was hooked as a fan. At the time of its release in 1984, it was some of the most progressive stuff available to the common man (or woman). So imagine my surprise to find out that a new CD release was imminent on ProgRock Records. Had the sound changed? Would it live up to expectations? Well I m here to tell you it s done all that in spades!<br><br>Planet P s new release is entitled 1931 and is the first of a three-part trilogy entitled Go Out Dancing. As such, this CD has been in gestation for some time, being recorded between 1992 and 2003. As with his other releases, this is very much the work of Tony Carey who is after all, Planet P Project. He does have some assistance on guitars, keyboards and background vocals but for the most this is his show. But forget any ideas you might have about thin-sounding, one-man-band recordings. This is cinemascope baby! <br><br>From the opening brooding atmospheric sound effects of My Radio Talks to Me I was hooked all over again. And speaking of hooks, Carey has that uncanny ability to write them and they re sprinkled throughout. Its worth mentioning that this is not prog of the complex-time-change-every-minute variety; instead, Planet P s prog style is one that incorporates concept, theme and a myriad of musical styles mixed with sound effects, dialog and solid musicianship. Little snippets of dialog are placed throughout the entire CD to propel the recordings overall theme. But the real power of this work is in the strength of the compositions, the songs. Take for example Work (will make you free) a song about being hauled off to a concentration camp that is strangely set in an unusual upbeat musical style that is right out of what could have been a propaganda soundtrack. This strange otherworldly juxtaposition enhances that cold brutality of what was happening to so many individuals. However, this is not a concept about just what was happening in Germany, it s much more than that. Carey presents a message for us today. The overriding theme of the recording is about the radical right in it s various guises and is perhaps best summarized by the line ready or not, well here they come, just like 1931 reprinted in the liner notes. <br><br>I can t remember the last time I was so excited about a new CD landing in my mailbox. After just one listen it was everything I was hoping for. If you enjoyed Planet P s Pink World, you ll love this, it s a logical extension of that style. If you ve never had a chance to hear Carey s work before start here. Planet P Project s 1931 easily makes my Top 10 for releases in 2005. I can hardly wait for parts two and three. --progressiveears']"

The music is devout and distinctly though indefinably English and varies greatly in mood, intensity, and expression. ""O vos omnes"" is a moving lamentation, while ""Valiant-for-Truth"" is startlingly dissonant and ends in a very convincing vocal imitation of trumpets.

Theres an old Buffalo Springfield song called Expecting To Fly that Neil Young wrote that he took a month to record because he wanted to get it just right. Weve done that too. Weve deliberated over a guitar sound that we know is in there somewhere and would make the song sound amazing."" Needless to say, Hal are equipped to do just that. Aside from Paul, 23, whose first band this is, they bring years of experience to bear upon their songs. Dave, 26, has been in groups since his early teens, having joined a shoegazing outfit when he was 14. Stephen, 27, an ex-archaeologist, started even younger, gracing his first band aged just 12. He had referenced everyone from The Cure to Joy Division before, via a friend, he met Dave in the late 90s. Immediately, the pair struck up a rare songwriting bond, composing for two years every night, though both of them had day jobs, obsessing over each and every aspect of Hals sound. <P>""Wed hang around at my dads house, in his backroom,"" says Dave. ""Hed come in sometimes and see us, a piano, a keyboard and piles of his dirty washing, and mutter something about us needing more lead guitar."" Instead of heeding Daves dads advice the pair enlisted Paul, whod cycle home, post-practice, from his fathers in Kiliney to his flat in the city centre, crashing out at 3am. The core of the group in place, they wowed The Sugar Club in Dublin, securing a gig a month until - six months into their schedule - Rough Trade beat a host of labels to their signatures. Since then theyve enjoyed a spate of on the road adventures, touring with Doves, The Delays, Starsailor and Grandaddy, none of whom sound like Hal. Then again, who does? <P>Maybe the idiosyncratic nature of the band can be ascribed to Dave, who is lovably odd himself. Not only is he blissfully unaware of other bands (""People say to me, Do you know this band and that band? And Ive never heard of any them""), but he enjoys collecting postcards and badges (""Ive got a very nice one of the zebra crossing at Abbey Road""); recording conversations which he slows down and/or speeds up, adapting them for use on his answering machine at home; and unearthing 18th century, er, gentlemens manuals. ""I found this book called A Gentlemens Companion: A Guide To Victorian Vices, which is a collection of all these stories about brothels and what a good brothel keeper should have in her boudoir.

Go to Tuva, for example, a remote republic in Siberia surrounded by mountains and filled with moonshiners, miners and cows. There you will find shamanic folk songs played on unpronounceable instruments by bearded men with grizzly, guttural voices that will pimple your skin forever. <P>And if you\'re really lucky, you\'ll stumble across Albert Kuvezin and his band Yat-Kha. Fighting against Communist musical censorship that tried to tell him what styles he could and couldn\'t play, Kuvezin has forged a near-impossible international reputation for his music. And with Yat-Kha, he combines Tuva\'s traditional music with the Western heavy rock he loves, chugging an electric guitar as he goes ""Oh yeeeeah"" in his filthy double-bass vocal. <P>After several albums of this punk-folk mish-mash, the logical next step is a covers record; and what a beast this is. From the opening strum of Led Zeppelin\'s \'When The Levee Breaks\', \'Re-Covers\' sets its stall as a reverent but unapologetic album. Simmering the song to its bones, Kuvezin rebuilds it as a Siberian folk masterpiece, his unnervingly deep growl spinning a magical, mesmeric tale over the delicate instrumentation. <P>And so they are all reworked. Kraftwerk\'s \'The Man Machine\' becomes a haunting canvass of guitar effects and acoustic play-about, with overtone chanting roaming for carrion. These eerie high-frequency melodies knock against the rich deep-throat bass vocal. Quite how they could come out of the same larynx - simultaneously or not - is a miracle. <P>Captain Beefheart\'s \'Her Eyes Are A Blue Million Miles\' takes on a dreamy Celtic quality; Motrhead\'s \'Orgasmatron\' swirls with black magic; and \'Play With Fire\' is a fair old walk from anything The Rolling Stones ever meant to write. <P>But it\'s not just rock stuff that gets the folk-me-up treatment. Hank Williams\' \'Ramblin\' Man\' takes that age-old tale of a man whose heart belongs to the train tracks and gives it a darkly wistful edge, with minimal rhythm pulsing like a heartbeat. Joy Division\'s \'Love Will Tear Us Apart\' falls slightly flat, its beautiful acoustic guitar lines marred by slightly off-key bear-growl vocals. And a Bob Marley track joins People\'s Music from Russia, Ireland and France, bobbing joyously with sweet percussion and a voice that sounds like a million cigarettes but is actually the product of one too many homemade vodkas. <P>This mix\'n\'match approach to traditional and Western styles sticks Yat-Kha miles above their contemporaries from Tuva, Mongolia and Russia, with excellent but less ambitious folk bands such as Egschiglen finding international appeal while choosing to stay loyal to their countries\' sound.']"

Amidst rich, moving harmonies and vocal arrangements, her songs explore aspects/angles of love and life in a voice of rare sincerity. Her sound is unique, drawing from the eclectic mix of her musical influences. A classically trained pianist, she grew up listening to everything from hip-hop, R&B, folk, pop, and even country music. There is no simple explanation for her soulful singing. ""I honestly don\'t know where it comes from. I wish I had an easy answer. Its just something thats always been inside of me. I don\'t know how to sing any other way."" She was introduced into the music scene in 2002, when she made a choice to pursue music over going to graduate school, much to the disapproval of her parents. While working at a deli in New York City, her demo caught the attention of the programming director of New York\'s Hot 97, and so began her musical career. Through a chance meeting, she met producer and songwriter Steve Francis (Stush Music) and an immediate creative connection was formed. ""It was a blessing to find someone who shared my vision and who allowed me the room to grow and find myself as an artist."" From their creative union, grew a project that was not unique to any one genre but drew from all of them. ""I realized a lot of my discomfort came from trying to fit in to external notions of what I should sound like, how I should sing. Now, I\'ve stopped trying to comply and learned to just be."" With the release of her debut album Dream In Pictures, Heather has established herself within the industry. Her album is an eclectic blend of styles and captivating vocals. Shes been featured in Jade Magazine, Asiance magazine, Asianmusicsource.com, and has performed on Imaginasian TV. Its a never-ending lesson, learning to love the skin youre in. Im certainly no exception. The songs in Dream in Pictures are an honest reflection of my heart and mind. Its such indescribable bliss to be able to write and sing music that finally resonates with your soul. I hope they resonate with your soul, too.']"

But perhaps that careful editing of the Warlock\'s confused and messy muse had everything do with the fact that the band employed Tim Rothrock (Beck, Badly Drawn Boy) to man the boards on their third offering--and to his extreme credit, Rothrock has been able to streamline the Warlock\'s rare and idiosyncratic genius.

The genealogical tree that incestuously links the likes of Tool, Medicine, Lusk, Failure, Blinker The Star, Autolux, Self, and countless others can be directly traced to Paul D\'Amour, the mastermind behind Feersum Ennjin. The history that spurred the creation of this debut melodic EP begins with the release and worldwide success of prog heavyweight Tool\'s full-length Undertow. As founding member, bassist, and consummate songwriter, Paul D\'Amour helped Tool become a household name with songs like ""Sober,"" ""Prison Sex,"" and ""Stinkfist."" Paul\'s distinctive playing and song writing left its imprint on some of the 90\'s most memorable and influential music and has inspired a whole generation of imitators. After years of touring and recording with the band, Paul left the confines of Tool to broaden his musical horizons. This lead to a number of new, colorful projects, including the Replicants, a glorified cover project featuring Ken Andrews (Failure), Greg Edwards (Failure/Autolux), and Chris Pitman (Guns N\' Roses) as well as the critically acclaimed Lusk, with Pitman, Edwards, and Brad Laner (Medicine/Electric Company). Lusk\'s Grammy-nominated release, Free Mars, was a departure from the harder edge of Tool and found its niche with an often psychedelic pop sound. Lusk startled Tool fans and awoke critics, who lauded the album\'s lyrical style and diverse musical explorations as the year\'s most unexpected treat. Free Mars went on to win the ""12 Angry Viewers"" video award for ""Backworlds"" (Paul co-directed the video with close friend Len Burge), which led to heavy rotation on MTV and substantial radio airplay. Returning to his homeland in the Pacific North West, Paul set up his own recording studio and worked with numerous N.W. bands. He also spent part of this time playing live and recording with the dark and dreamy Queen Maud Land. With his Seattle expedition complete, Paul is now back in Los Angeles to continue the ongoing metamorphosis of his musical endeavors. Feersum Ennjin is an amalgam of lessons learned between being part of a groundbreaking progressive rock band and an intensely experimental and expansive musical period. Written, performed, and produced by D\'Amour in his Topanga Canyon studio and at Matt Mahaffey of Self\'s recording studio (featuring Matt on drums), Feersum Ennjin begins a powerful new era for the master artificer. The dark sensibilities of Feersum Ennjin\'s five songs combine a hard rock exterior with a melodic core, fused together by lyrical sophistication and an electronic undercurrent. The power and aggression within are reminiscent of Tool, but are enhanced by the ever-expanding view from D\'Amour\'s musical chair. Lush harmonies, dynamic changes, and epic intentions allow for a wide range of styles and instrumentation harkening the dark melody of Bauhaus/Interpol with the arc of Pink Floyd and the driving force of Queens of the Stone Age. By bringing together the ideals and lessons learned from being in a world renowned rock band, forging new paths in experimental pop, and working independently to fine-tune his craft, Paul D\'Amour has created a sound that understands the delicate balance between hard rock, experimental tendencies, and appealing melody. Feersum Ennjin proves that bridging the gap between these ideals is not only possible, but leaves you wanting more. Tool fans won\'t be disappointed, and new fans will be anointed.']"

Casual fans be warned: This is not a concert film, per se, nor will it satisfy anyone looking for a comprehensive history of ""The Pink Floyd"" (as the group was originally known) in its earliest incarnation. Rather, Peter Whitehead\'s film--originally titled <i>Tonite Let\'s All Make Love in London</i> (after a line from an Allen Ginsberg poem)--was created as a dreamy, avant-garde portrait of the ""Swinging London"" scene, set to the music of Pink Floyd (in this case the improvisational epics ""Interstellar Overdrive"" and ""Nick\'s Boogie""), accompanied by performance footage from the legendary UFO Club in 1966, a recording session at London\'s Sound Techniques studio on January 11, 1967 (which Whitehead specifically arranged to capture his soundtrack), and footage from the momentous ""14 Hour Technicolor Dream"" festival held at Alexandra Palace on April 29th, 1967. White combined elements of all three events to create his audiovisual collage--a kind of time-capsule mindscape that successfully conveys the spacey atmosphere of Pink Floyd\'s early (and instant) popularity.', 'However fleeting (he\'s glimpsed relatively briefly, coaxing otherworldly sounds from his guitar, patched into a Binson Echorec tape echo device), the presence of Floyd cofounder Syd Barrett will prove fascinating to any devoted fan.

Rick Wright appears calmly at his keyboard (also using the Binson Echorec), and Nick Mason drums through his experimental ""Boogie,"" parts of which were transposed into the title track of <i>A Saucerful of Secrets</i>. The music (far more indicative of Early Floyd than the later studio versions) is also included on a stand-alone CD, and while none of this material is substantial enough to be truly fulfilling, it remains a priceless snapshot of the era, with fascinating glimpses of John Lennon attending the ""Technicolor"" event, unaware that his future wife, Yoko Ono, was presenting a performance-art installment just a few feet away. Whitehead\'s archival interview clips with Mick Jagger, Michael Caine, Julie Christie, and artist David Hockney add another facet of insight into one of the liveliest periods of popular culture. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i>']"

A full thirty-five years after her only previous album, the singer returns with a new solo work, her first in all these years, and it is a breathtakingly beautiful album. <P>Produced by fellow Edinburgh resident Max Richter (who has a wonderful solo album of his own, Blue Notebooks), and co-arranged with Bunyan, it\'s a rich, beautifully arranged and stirring album. Developing gradually and organically -- with work initially taking place between Richter and Bunyan\'s homes, and then at various studios in Edinburgh, London and Glasgow -- <i>Lookaftering</i> is anchored around Bunyan\'s voice and picked acoustic guitar, Richter\'s piano playing and arranging. Its instrumentation includes a string quartet, oboe, harp, French horn, and recorder, flute, hammer dulcimer, glasses, harmonium, and Rhodes piano, and it features contributions from Joanna Newsom, Devendra Banhart, Adem, Adam Pierce (Mice Parade), Robert Kirby (Nick Drake), Otto Hauser and Kevin Barker (Espers, Currituck County) <P>As well as a neat balance between gentle, sparse songs and heavier, more orchestrated numbers, there is a beautiful play between the lush instrumental arrangements and the incredibly intimate, in-your-ear presence of Bunyan\'s voice. There\'s a real honesty to the album -- from the fragile intimacy of the vocal itself to the stories that it weaves. Just as <i>JADD</i> was a very pure document of a journey, Lookaftering is similarly based on stories taken directly from lived experience (the death of a brother; the joys and fears of motherhood; the tension between freedom and commitment; and travel versus domesticity). There\'s also a great integrity forged from the cohesiveness between lyrical content and musical form (the gentle rolling and pitching of the melodies on ""Same But Different""; the vocal roundelay on ""Here Before""; the ice-shiver of dulcimer on ""Turning Backs"").

Despite the success of his 1985 album <i>Highwayman</i>, Cash had been dropped by Columbia, his label of 28 years, and one can sense a hint of weariness in this otherwise-fine performance. As evident by the warm, enthusiastic audience, this eclectic gig also hints at the personal and professional revival that Cash would enjoy in his later years with producer Rick Rubin. Like many of Cash\'s typical tour gigs, this one opens to the familiar strains of ""Ring of Fire,"" and includes a handful of hits (""Folsom Prison Blues,"" ""I Walk the Line,"" ""Long Black Veil"") along with a few rarities thrown in for good measure. Recommended to Johnny by Kris Kristofferson, a cover of John Prine\'s heartbreaking song ""Sam Stone""--about the travails of a heroin-addicted Vietnam veteran--proves to be a perfect fit for Johnny (and a personal favorite), although Johnny (ever the devout Christian) changes the lyric ""Jesus Christ died for nothin\', I suppose"" to ""Daddy must have suffered a lot back then, I suppose,"" while retaining the song\'s sad, tragic tone. Cash then follows with a crowd-pleasing rendition of ""(Ghost) Riders in the Sky,"" and his devoted wife, June Carter Cash, joins Johnny on ""Where Did We Go Right?,"" a song by David Loggins (newly recorded at the time) that serves as a fitting tribute to the Cashes\' long-term marriage.

This web across the American map made for the early construction of Paul's complex and self-made history in song. Living rooms became studios, scrap wood became vocal booths, and open windows yielded a sea of sound. The racket of everyday melded with the skilled hand of a multi-instrumentalist. At age 26 and in the flurry of NYC, Paul has created Be Careful What You Call Home. His 2003 debut, To An Ambient Hollywood, introduced a multi-faceted musician and vocalist  and perhaps a mysterious voice from the South. While Indie Workshop called it, a beautiful soft-shoed singer songwriter album full of fleshed out, full bloom songs and Fake Jazz saw its influence from electronic, progressive music like Brian Eno and Talk Talk, Paul Duncan was well on his way to an entirely new document. A mental score. A geographical response. The architecture of Be Careful What You Call Home belongs almost anywhere, but it found itself at the source: I began by wanting to hear and experience things that might take me out of a small town mentality  and I realized that small town experience is something that makes me exist, Paul said. Like its precedent, Be Careful What You Call Home is home-made with a range of musical ingredients. Self-taught, Paul utilizes guitar, bass, piano, electronics, cello, drums, etc. His move to New York reunited him with longtime friends/musicians and introduced him to new ones, enabling him to create an ensemble for live performance and for accompaniment on recordings. Claudia Deheza (of the late On Air Library and longtime collaborator with Scott Herren in Savath and Savalas and with Prefuse 73) has workedclosely with Paul over the past few months, lending her voice to live performances and to an upcoming limited 7 release. Joe Stickney, an Alabama-born painter and drummer, provides percussion (as he does for Eastern Developments Bear In Heaven, as well). Adam Wills (also of Bear In Heaven), who is working on a video from Be Careful What You Call Home, plays guitar. James Elliot (part of the label Antiopic with his own release under the name Ateleia) plays bass. The translation into live performance has added a dimension to Pauls entire process  one more confident and apt to embrace the very avant-pop dynamics that set him apart. Introduced to and compelled by the likes of Luc Ferrari, Morton Feldman, Arnold Dreyblatt, et al while studying sound design in college, Paul took to a language that combined with his own real and imaginary scenarios. A drunk uncle and his third wife, a love that never happened, a death that Ive dealt with he lists.

Be Careful What You Call Home comes complete with a lyric book, allowing words to accompany the records inherent sonic storytelling. Despite this lyrical reveal, which might convey a desire tocommunicate beyond the sole power of the recorded uttered voice, Paul said, There's a brevity to some of the songs on the new album for a reason - some of those songs don't have a long life.

Paul Duncan has collected many comparisons  from The Sea and Cake, Nick Drake, and Iron and Wine to specific works by Eno and to the varied nature of Jim ORourke.

B000CAA1K2,A1S7BFT0HDF3HA,1,1199664000,...And Twiced as Gone,Greg Spradlin,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Blues']","['What sweet redemption for Greg Spradlin. A longtime guitarist and songwriter and well-respected figure in the Little Rock music scene, Spradlin has for many years flirted with the brighter lights of the music industry only to be thwarted by cutbacks or legal snarls or general bad luck. He\'s been in a number of bands including the late, lamented SkeeterHawks and caught the attention of Steve Earle and others only to have nothing to show for it other than some eye-popping tales of horrendous contracts and inept lawyers. Unable to clean music out of his veins, Spradlin, now leading the Greg Spradlin Outfit, has just released a glorious new record, ...and Twiced as Gone, recorded in part at his home in down- town Little Rock. It\'s no wonder that Spradlin has struggled to fit into the straitjacket the music industry would slap him in. His new CD, a gospel testament with a throbbing rock \'n\' roll kick, is loaded with terrific music that defies easy classification. In a press release Spradlin says he has ""been trying to make this record for 10 years."" It\'s not hard to tell. ""Get right church and let\'s go home,"" Spradlin preaches on ""Ride On"" with enough conviction to move several congregations. Spradlin, a native of Pangburn, AR, absorbs seemingly every facet of Arkansas musical history and throws it back out with his own twist. As a result, ... and Twiced as Gone sounds at once new and old, familiar and fresh. Practically every track is soaked in blues riffs, sharp country slides and soaring gospel voices. The searing sound comes from Spradlin\'s band, drummer Doug Simpson and bassist Scott Finney, and guests. Spradlin uncovers gospel treasures Friendly Womack, brother of Bobby Womack, and Pastor Stephen Christian who lend soulful, spirit-filling voices to various tracks. Jim Dickinson, legendary producer, noted keyboardist and something of a protege for Spradlin, is also on board. Things get off to a thrilling start with ""Country Blues #1,"" a lightning fast ride down a back road. Spradlin\'s high voice may not be professionally polished but he knows how to set a mood. You can feel the heat and weariness in ""Feel Like Dust"" and likewise resignation and the hope for redemption in ""Push Me Down."" But it\'s on his reworking of the traditional spiritual ""Working on a Building"" where Spradlin gives the divine a high-octane boost. With its ominous, Z.Z. Top-like guitar runs and spooky harmonica breaks, the song could move Pinnacle Mountain down to the altar to take communion. When you think Spradlin couldn\'t pull any more tricks out of his bag, ""Out of Blue,"" the next track, has steel guitar licks as hot as the summer sun bouncing off the asphalt. But all in all, this is great, down-home comfort food, made even more delicious because of how it signifies that Spradlin is back in the kitchen. So forget those lawyers and rigged contracts and keep on preaching, preacher. ~Werner Trieschmann, Democrat-Gazette']"

Producing a Neil Diamond album has been a long-time dream for Rubin, whose extraordinary resume spans the history of hip-hop from LL Cool J to Jay Z, the world of hardcore rock from Slayer to System Of A Down, and the pantheon of mythic stars from Tom Petty and Donovan to Mick Jagger and Johnny Cash\'s immortal Grammy-winning American Recordings series. <P>""Most of the songs were recorded with Neil playing and singing at the same time,"" said Rick Rubin in a Rolling Stone article (9/22/05) profiling the producer, ""and it\'s a different animal. It\'s taking him back to being more of a singer-songwriter. He really blows me away."" <P>When it came time to record 12 Songs, Rick Rubin assembled a sympathetic ensemble of musicians to capture the essence of Neil Diamond\'s extraordinary new songs, each of them a finely-wrought gem, soul-searching, honest, yearning, and powerful. <P>A core group of musicians made up of Mike Campbell (guitar) and Benmont Tench (piano/organ) from Tom Petty\'s Heartbreakers and guitarist Smokey Hormel (Beck, Tom Waits) and other musicians including the renowned Larry Knechtel (piano) and Billy Preston (organ) played on the album. <P>The track listing for 12 Songs is: ""Oh Mary,"" ""Hell Yeah,"" ""Captain of a Shipwreck,"" ""Evermore,"" ""Save Me A Saturday Night,"" ""Delirious Love,"" ""I\'m On To You,"" ""What\'s It Gonna Be,"" ""Man of God,"" ""Create Me,"" ""Face Me,"" and ""We."" A special digipak edition of 12 Songs features two bonus tracks: ""Men Are So Easy"" and an alternate version of ""Delirious Love"" with guest artist Brian Wilson. <P>"".judging by eight finished tracks,"" wrote Lorraine Ali, previewing 12 Songs for Newsweek (August 1, 2005), ""this is the best work Diamond has done in 30 years.""', 'Forget for a moment that you\'re a sophisticated consumer of music with a mercilessly low tolerance for schlock: Neil Diamond--""Cracklin\' Rosie"" and ""Forever in Blue Jeans"" be damned--is going to break your heart. <i>12 Songs</i>, the hotly anticipated collaboration between Rick Rubin and the formerly jumpsuited Don Juan, exceeds all hopped-up expectations, deflating fans\' concerns that their hero might fall flat on the frames of his huge sunglasses in attempting to turn out something hip and harnessing what sounds like decades\' worth of untapped, superior songcraft instead. There it is on ""Captain of a Shipwreck,"" a declaration of love that skims the poetic with its promise that ""If you\'re captain of a shipwreck/I\'ll be first mate to your shame,"" and around it comes again on ""Hell Yeah,"" a life-affirming, rumor-debunking anthem fairly bursting with bravado (think ""I Am...I Said,"" but with context). Bravado aside, expect no pulled punches here. Rubin\'s masterful approach is to let Neil Diamond do what Neil Diamond does best, and that is to strap on a loose guitar and let those teflon-ravaged vocals ride over it. Some rides, of course, are smoother than others--Brian Wilson\'s guest spot on bonus track ""Delirious Love"" is so melodic and harmony-rich it ought to have sails attached, while ""What\'s It Gonna Be"" sounds like something snatched in a pre-dawn lark from a Leonard Cohen disc. All of it is lovely, every last track.

Three studio albums into the second phase of their career, the Go-Betweens present a live DVD/CD package loaded with goodies for their fans. The Cd includes a 90-minute full-band concert in their hometown of Brisbane, Australia.

Yep Roc. 2006.', 'Like REM, Brisbane, Australia\'s Go-Betweens established a huge early-1980s reputation as kings of intelligent jangle pop. And if critical praise were commercial currency, then the Go-Betweens would, in fact, be bigger than REM. But co-leaders Robert Forster and Grant McLennan never found fame commensurate with their songwriting, disbanding for the 1990s and then cutting three peerless albums since 2001. In May, 2006, though, McLennan suddenly died -- on the heels of this career-spanning live set, a CD/DVD combo that unabashedly shows off the band\'s offhand genius. The DVD captures 16-songs from Brisbane\'s Tivoli, along with 10 additional live acoustic Forster and McLennan duets. Then, the accompanying CD features the first 16-song live set, veering from heartfelt acoustic duos of ""Black Mule"" and ""Clouds"" to 14 full-band tunes that are unerringly wonderful. Clear-toned guitars, spare rhythm accompaniment, and simply brilliant writing mark every song, from the mellowest to the most urgent (McLennan\'s ""Was There Anything I Could Do""). The band equally emphasizes their final studio album, <i>Oceans Apart</i>, and their original 1988 swan song, <i>16 Lovers Lane</i>, with four tracks from each. Then they range back to their late-70s early days with ""People Saying"" and ""Karen,"" bouncy and then menacing, covering an emotional range the band made their own until McLennan\'s tragic passing.

Gerard Schwarz', 'The story of Cossack Stepan Razin, who, in the 17th century, led a bloody peasants\' revolt against the Tsar, is perfect fodder for Shostakovich. This rarely performed cantata is an exciting, violent work. Composed in 1964, with Shostakovich free of Stalin\'s repression, it shows the composer at his most angry, bitter, and sorrowful. Razin\'s piercing eyes, shining out even more brightly from his severed head, terrified the Tsar; in the words of the cantata\'s narrator (from a poem by Yevtushenko) ""without concealing its triumph/the head began to guffaw at the Tsar."" Bass-baritone Charles Robert Austin sings both Razin and the narrator with force and great expression. Gerard Schwarz and his Seattle Symphony whip the score into a frenzy. The 13-minute tone poem ""October"" is another rarity, commemorating the October Revolution. It quotes from the 10th Symphony but is entirely original in conception: beginning moderately, it ends in a maniacal march. The final work is ""Five Fragments,"" and it is just that: a series of bits, none longer than 4 minutes long, that are ""practice runs"" for the 4th Symphony. They are worth hearing: one features bassoon, clarinet, and oboe, another is sweet and tender, and the last, beginning with snare drum and violin, is nice and creepy. Highly recommended. <i>--Robert Levine</i>']"

A very large audience (including relatives of the victims) attended this memorial concert, held in memory of the 270 people who died. The program of this concert, devised by Bryars with the help of John Potter of the Hilliard Ensemble and Richard Campbell of Fretwork, consists of works Bryars had written for both the Hilliard Ensemble and Fretwork heard alongside pieces of early music. The Hilliard Ensemble is one of the worlds most celebrated choral groups. They have recorded extensively for the ECM label and have reached the Billboard bestseller lists on numerous occasions. Their repertoire ranges from medieval and Renaissance polyphony to many modern works, including a series of best-selling recordings for ECM of the music of Arvo Prt. Fretwork is the worlds foremost viol consort. Recordings from both groups have been hailed as the best in their genre, and both have won numerous awards. The Lockerbie Memorial Concert marked the first time that these two legendary groups, the Hilliard Ensemble and Fretwork, had performed together in a live concert.']"

(\'Keep A Steady Hustle\') is set to unleash his magnum opus, ""Turf War Syndrome"", on a world now weary of commercialized gangsta fables and the prostitution of hip-hop.

From the opening retro stylings of ""American Nightmare"" to the disturbing, almost cinematic critiques of society found in ""Made In America,"" the listener is transported into the harsh realities of life that permeate ""Turf War Syndrome"", as T-K.A.S.H. paints haunting images of struggle and persistence in life on the street. Conceptualized in documentary form, the album continues, by way of seamless transition, into the celebratory ""In My Drawz,"" a solid dance track that is a \'Trojan horse,\' as its feel-good tone serves to mask its true meaning - a call to armed revolution if conditions for the poor and underrepresented don\'t improve soon.

T-K.A.S.H. initially got his start by working closely with Bay Area radio show legend Davey D at KPFA radio in Berkeley, CA.

By already having dedicated underground acceptance for his activism and ongoing work through non-commercial radio, T-K.A.S.H. is quickly becoming a Bay Area hip-hop icon in his own right.

This is her fourth solo CD: each previous one is fascinating, filled with brilliant performances and a sheer love of music-making, and each one has garnered rave reviews. Clearly it is her avoidance of standard repertoire that is keeping Lin a semi-secret: I urge you to break the spell and allow her to introduce you to some unfamiliar music. This is an album of razzle-dazzle, contemporary piano music. Two of the pieces were composed in the 1970s and \'80s, the rest are less than 15 years old. The CD begins with Arthur Kampela\'s ""Nosturnos,"" an excursion into a whirlwind of notes which will keep you riveted. Three Etudes (Nos. 16-18) by Ligeti follow. The first is utterly lovely and easy-going to start, gaining speed and changing mood half way through until it tinkles away into the ether; the second seems like a game of chase; the third, and briefest, is at first limping, then runs like a demon. ""Chromatic Canon"" by James Tenney is a minimalist piece in which Lin plays both live and along with a tape of herself playing another part; it is a hypnotic arc of music filled with itchy dissonances. Claude Vivier\'s ""Shiraz"" is based on a four-note chord pounded away into dozens of alternate-sounding configurations. Elliott Sharp\'s ""Suberrebus"" combines piano with computer processing; the different hues you\'ll hear will keep you on your toes. And there are a couple of other remarkable pieces as well. This CD is not for the timid: but jump in, the water\'s unexpectedly fine. And Jenny Lin, to contradict the CD\'s title, sounds as if she has 14 fingers--each perfectly under control. <i>--Robert Levine</i>', 'Jenny Lin is one of the most respected young pianists today, admired for her adventurous programming and charismatic stage presence. She continues to receive accolades worldwide as an orchestral soloist, recitalist, and chamber musician. The New York Times writes: ""No one who has heard [her] will need to be told that Ms. Lin has a gift for melodic flow"" and ""remarkable technical command;"" The Washington Post praises ""Lin\'s confident fingers... spectacular technique..."" and Gramophone magazine has hailed her as ""an exceptionally sensitive pianist."" Her performances have taken her to venues such as Carnegie Recital Hall, Kennedy Center, Miller Theatre, Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum in New York, as well as at Chopin, Archipel, Flanders, Divonne, Ars Musica and BAM\'s Next Wave Festivals, with groups such as Ensemble Contrechamps, Millennium Festival Orchestra, Orchestra Carbon, National Symphony of Taiwan, and Flemish Radio Orchestra. She is also the soloist in the new documentary, Zahara, by Elemental Films Spain. Highlights of Jenny\'s upcoming season include concerts in France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States, on the stages of Museum of Art and History Geneva, Merkin Concert Hall, Symphony Space, Corcoran Gallery in Washington D.C., Spoleto Festival USA and with Orchestra Sinfonica Nationale della RAI and SWR Rundfunkorchester. Jenny\'s latest album Preludes to a Revolution (Russian Piano Preludes 1905-1922) has been heralded as ""...a darn good listen"" (The New York Times), ""...a fascinating CD"" (Joseph McLellan of the Washington Post) and further evidence of Lin\'s musical ""sensitivity and emotional depth"" (American Record Guide). Her discography also includes critically acclaimed recordings of the complete piano music of Ruth Crawford Seeger, Chinoiserie (a collection of works by Western composers inspired by China), a Liszt Sonata and Schumann Fantasy, and works by Chinese composers Guan Xia and Ma Yo-Dao. Jenny studied with Noel Flores at the Hochschule fr Musik in Vienna, with Julian Martin at the Peabody Conservatory (Artist Diploma) in Baltimore, and with Dominique Weber in Geneva. She has also worked with Richard Goode and Blanca Uribe in New York, and with Dimitri Bashkirov and Andreas Staier at the Fondazione Internazionale per il pianoforte in Cadenabbia, Italy.

As anybody who\'s seen <i>Postcards from the Edge</i> knows, Streep can really sing, and she sounds great in the rootsy, old-style country vein that makes up most of this soundtrack. Her rollicking duets with her screen sister Lily Tomlin, ""My Minnesota Home"" and ""Goodbye to My Mama,"" are priceless. Woody Harrelson and John C.

Their career has spanned nine albums and numerous 4 and 5 star reviews across the globe. Don Peris\' unique and unmistakable guitar tones dip and soar, shimmer with tremolo, and create strong melodies in a memorable collection of songs. This is also the newest release on Badman Recording Co.\'s new mostly instrumental label Jemez Mountain (pronounced ""hey-mez""). If you listen closely you can also hear the occasional strains of Paul Simon, Chet Atkins, Lindsey Buckingham and Nick Drake. Like the sea on the Polaroid cover of Go When The Morning Shineth, the music is deep and inviting and Don\'s soul-filled playing sings and moves. Don Peris tells us, ""My summers have always included trips to Atlantic beaches. The summer holiday picture on the cover of the CD was shot many years ago by my dad with his Polaroid Land Camera."" North Atlantic Sand, one of two songs that contain lyrics and vocals, was written during the winter and in Pennsylvania. ""It\'s a remembrance of early trips to Delaware and New Jersey beaches, though it\'s also a love song to my daughter."" Don is joined in singing this song by his wife Karen Peris. While ""Day Trip"", ""Jubilee"", and ""Glimmer"" are all attempts at expressing joy, there is also a mingling of melancholy. Perhaps an awareness of time passing, or a longing towards things as yet undefined. ""Even in the most joyful of moments there can be layers and a longing. The ""Ravel Pavane"" is a perfect example of this. Here, in the midst of these beautiful major 7th chords is deep emotion and yearning. With ""Flyer"", I had it in mind to start out small in scope, just the guitar floating in reverb and chromaticism over low-strung cello notes, and then have it swell to something more grand by the end,"" says Peris. Don\'s influences are broad and varied. It\'s not surprising that when asked about his favorites, his answer includes records like Talk Talk\'s Laughing Stock, M. Ward\'s Transfiguration of Vincent, and John Lennon\'s Julia. Peris tells us, ""Julia is my very favorite song! I love the words and the sound of John\'s voice and guitar. And that guitar part. When I hear it, it\'s as if I\'ve always known this part and have been carrying it around with me forever.""']"

Featuring the AAA single ""What Would Jesus Do?"", Rise is an understated meditation on survival in New Orleans recorded in Nashville and LA, two of several cities King found himself in after being evacuated from his hometown.', 'Louisiana bluesman Chris Thomas King\'s brilliant and beautiful <i>Rise</i> is an ode to New Orleans and its people after Katrina. These 11 songs ricochet between hope and tragedy, creating a emotionally complex cycle that\'s buoyed by his carefully considered performances--full of weeping electric guitar melodies and his gentlest, most soulful singing. The opening King-penned trilogy ""What Would Jesus Do?,"" ""Faith,"" and ""Baptized in Dirty Water"" essays the tests of strength and spirit that came with the floodwaters. King examines the nature of justice in these songs, raising questions about the federal government\'s blindness to the unfolding disaster and the moral compromises many needed to make to survive. He\'s also given some Crescent City classics new meaning. His take on the chestnut ""St. James Infirmary"" reflects on the musical history of New Orleans as well as the loss of life caused by the hurricane. And when Louis Armstrong\'s sweetly upbeat ""What a Wonderful World"" closes the album, its joyful lyrics provide an ironic counterpoint to the pain and suffering King chronicles as the rest of <i>Rise</i>\'s thoughtful songs unspool. <i>--Ted Drozdowski</i>']"

And they do it with an undercurrent of humor even when themes turn darker. <P>Pull the Brake finds the band reunited with producer Chris Kress (Ben Kweller, Dave Matthews). Andy Stepanian (vocals, guitar, keyboard) and Chase Heard(vocals, guitar, banjo) share songwriting duties on the album. Stepanian is drawn toward darker themes, while Heard has more of a pop sensibility. It is the tension between these two voices that accounts for the bands rich and varied musical texture. Mason Brent(vocals, guitar, mandolin, pedal steel) once again shines with his scorching guitar solos and tasty flourishes on the mandolin. And Blake Gayle (drums)provides a stripped-down style of playing adding a ragged feel to the music. Cult-hero Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy also shows up to lend supporting vocals on the hauntingly beautiful ""Lowlight."" <P>While their first album, Minor Enough, had all the comforts of home, Pull the Brake treads darker ground. Many of the characters in these songs are all too familiar with the temptations that the night offers. But there are still some good-time rockers that offer redemption.

(aka Mash-Out Posse) is back again. Comprised of rappers Lil Fame (aka Fizzy Womack) and Billy Danzenie (aka Billy Danze), the group is best known for their frenetic hit single 2000s Ante Up. But throughout their career M.O.P. have consistently delivered the hardest, angriest and loudest music Hip Hop could offer. Childhood friends Fame (Jamal Grinnage) and Danze (Eric Murray) grew up in the roughest area of Brownsville (Brooklyn, NY) and were members of a neighborhood gang named Mash Out Posse. They debuted in 1993 with the single How About Some Hardcore. The underground success of the single, promoted by a gritty, low-budget video from then-unknown director Hype Williams led to their debut album, To The Death, a dark and raging LP, was released in 1994 on on the small label, Select Records. The album was fully produced by DR Period. How About Some Hardcore became one of the biggest hardcore rap anthems of the 90s. In 1996, M.O.P. released their second effort, Firing Squad. Hoping for better promotion, they signed with Relativity Records. Despite changing record labels and producers (the album was produced by DJ Premier and Lil Fame himself), M.O.P. continued hitting fans ears with tough, menacing beats and their extremely hardcore, energetic delivery. Two years later, M.O.P. released First Family 4 Life, working on the same formula as ever, again with heavy percentage of DJ Premiers production and more gems produced by Lil Fame. M.O.P.s fanbase was loyal but remained rather small until 2000, when they released Warriorz, this time on Loud Records. Mainstream radio began playing the first single, Ante Up, produced by DR Period whom they had not worked with since their debut. The single was a major radio hit and propelled the album to #25 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart. The follow-up single, the self-produced Cold As Ice which featured a sample from Cold As Ice by Foreigner, also received radio airplay, although almost half of the songs lyrics had to be censored for the radio version. Warriorz is the last major-label release from M.O.P. to date. In 2002, Loud Records folded, leaving the group stranded. They recorded a full length album titled Ghetto Warfare, but the eagerly anticipated album was shelved. In order to keep their music on the streets, the Posse released a mixtape titled Marxmen Cinema under the name, The Marxmen. M.O.P. also independently released a self-titled rock-rap album under the name, Mash Out Posse. Jump to July 2006, the never before heard album Ghetto Warfare has surfaced, and it is finally available to the masses. Nineteen tracks deep, and filled with all the standard M.O.P. subject matter we have all grown to love, the album contains rhymes about battling with rival criminals and serious talk about life in the ghetto.

MIG endeavored to sell the record on his own website, and even enlisted the help of Queen guitarist Brian May on one of the tracks. It was at precisely this time that the opportunity for Rockstar presented itself. MIG ventured from London to Los Angeles for a successful audition, going on to compete on national television for the chance to become the new lead singer for Aussie band INXS. As the show progressed, he became a quick star with his emotional honesty, and consistent charismatic performances week after week. <P>MIG also mastered the piano at a young age, mostly playing Billy Joel tunes.

Where ""Two Hands"" chronicled Fleishers triumphant return to performing two-handed repertoire after 35 years, ""The Journey"" tells the rest of the story. <P>The works performed on ""The Journey"" are the pieces of music that Fleisher was preparing to perform in solo recitals at the time that dystonia began to affect his performing career in the early 1960s. <P>""The Journey"" matches solo piano works rarely recorded, like Stravinskys \'Serenade in A,\' with the beautiful, melancholy touch that Leon Fleisher brings to popular works such as Chopins \'Berceuse\' and Beethovens \'Fr Elise.\' The technical ability of a great pianist meets the poetic touch of a master in Bachs \'Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue\' and Mozarts \'Sonata in E flat,\' K. 272. <P>Mr. Fleisher is interviewed on Disc Two by Bob Edwards of XM Radio\'s \'The Bob Edwards Show.\'', 'Leon Fleischer is the extraordinary pianist who lost the use of his right hand to a neurological ailment in 1964 at the height of his career. Undaunted, he took up teaching, conducting, and performing the left-hand literature so brilliantly that it was hard to believe he was using only one hand. When he returned to two-handed playing after years of medical treatments and determined, arduous rehabilitation, the public greeted him not only as a great artist but a conquering hero. This disc is his second two-handed recording (the first, <i>Two Hands</i>, was released in 2004). The title refers to the journey of life which, Fleischer says, ""matters more than the destinations."" The program features works Fleischer had performed regularly before 1964 but never recorded. Now in his late 70s, Fleischer plays with patrician authority and an unfailing sense of structure and style. His technical mastery seems fully intact, his tone is beautiful and variable, his youthful vigor remarkable. His Bach is especially striking for its simple directness and the clarity of its texture and counterpoint. In the Capriccio ""On the Departure of a Brother,"" a piece of real ""program music,"" he brings out the lamentation and the humor; in the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue the build-ups are very dramatic, the runs carefully shaped. Chopin\'s ""Berceuse"" is dreamy and singing. Stravinsky\'s ""Serenade"" alternates percussive passages with sardonic ""melodies,"" and includes a marathon perpetual motion. An early, relatively unfamiliar Mozart sonata is fussy and unspontaneous, but Beethoven\'s very familiar ""Fr Elise"" is beautiful. Is Fleischer demonstrating how this lovely piece, all too frequently heard on student recitals and telephones, should really sound? <i>--Edith Eisler</i>']"

Yearly headlining gigs at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival notwithstanding, the band--who have yet to lose a member in nearly three decades--haven\'t managed to crack either the fertile jam market or the blues rock one. That\'s because most of their recordings have failed to combine the restless funk, blues, R&amp;B, and rock influences into memorable original songs or coherent albums. That problem is not solved on this collection, the band\'s first post-Katrina album (first in five years, actually)--but there remains plenty to enjoy, even if lead singer Ed Volker\'s dusky voice isn\'t distinctive enough to propel this typically eclectic set of ballads and rockers, despite the band\'s muscular performance.

The band is difficult to pigeonhole, but a greasy Crescent City vibe covers each track. Like most Radiators studio releases, the rootsy songs are well played but don\'t pack a robust enough punch. A jolt of live juice to shake the dust off and nail a groove, as they typically do in concert, would work wonders. As difficult to dislike as it is to get excited about, the well-intentioned <i>Dreaming Out Loud</i> could use a shot of caffeine to wake up these performances. <I>--Hal Horowitz</i>']"

Today's violin soloists are so well trained that we tend to forget the difference between great technique and great timbre. Julia Fischer has both. Right from the opening of the first movement her sound positively glows."", ""Young violinists sometimes turn war horses like the Tchaikovsky Concerto into superficial virtuoso displays to show off their technique, but Julia Fischer gives us a thoughtfully nuanced view of the work that exposes details often ignored. Her tone is beautiful, and she varies it to fit the emotional content of the passages she is playing. While her performance is expressive, it is also a mature one -- she doesn't milk parts for their surface impact, rather she digs more deeply into the music to produce a performance that will bear many rehearings. While Fischer generates plenty of excitement in the outer movements, the Canzonetta remains in the memory for the sweet singing of her violin. Her lyric sensibility also makes for a <i>Srnade mlincolique</i> stunning in its spare beauty. The <i>Valse-Scherzo</i>, Op. 34, is done with plenty of dash, and the three-movement <I>Souvenir d'un lieu cher</I> is superbly done.

The album closes with the epic, two-part ""Sunken Dreams,"" which wraps the group\'s muscular guitar-driven nucleus in a vocal choir, waves of reverb, and elements of musique concrete to create a sweeping backdrop for a tale of love among the ruins of a post-nuclear world--or a barren soul. It\'s captivating. <i>--Ted Drozdowski</i>']"

Nine Horses is a collaborative project that brings together Sylvian, his brother Steve Jansen (ex-Japan), and the well respected Burnt Friedman. This mini album includes two new tracks, 'Money For All' and 'Get The Hell Out'."", 'Remix projects are often commercially motivated ventures that jettison everything that made a track personal and expressive in favor of thudding, generic dance beats that will get played in clubs and on the radio.  But as is usually the case, singer David Sylvian has a different approach.  Nine Horses is his project with his brother and drummer, Steve Jansen, and electronica artist Burnt Friedman. They take songs from the 2006 release <a href=""/gp/product/B000B8GUGO/""><i>Snow Borne Sorrow</i></a> and find new dimensions in their already multifaceted songs.  These are more reimaginings than remixes.  The slow electro-soul of ""The Banality of Evil"" becomes an ethereal New Orleans dirge that brings out Sylvian\'s baleful lyrics like a lost voodoo prayer.  ""Wonderful World"" emphasizes Keith Lowe\'s slinky double bass line, underscoring the already smoke-filled jazz noir feel this track had in its original form.  Stina Nordenstam sings the chorus on that, and the remix makes her fractured soprano an even more startling contrast with Sylvian\'s dolorously fudgy tenor.  Nordenstam takes the lead on the hallucinatory lullaby of ""Birds Sing for Their Lives,"" originally a Japanese-only bonus track.  There are also new tracks: the funky and acerbic ""Money for All"" and the ominous, but still funky ""Get the Hell Out,"" the latter full of glitchy beats and chamber strings.  Both are reheated in alternate versions as well.  You can\'t dance to the remixes of <i>Money for All</i>, but you can go deeper into the world of David Sylvian. <i>--John Diliberto</i>']"

Simply reaching their potential isn\'t a motivation for this band, surpassing their own expectations and abilities are just a taste of their intentions and existence. <P>Adelaide\'s I Killed The Prom Queen unleashed a more powerful and dynamic debut full length than has yet to be experienced by most. ""When Goodbye Means Forever"", debuted in the Adelaide charts at #1 where and remained in that position many weeks after its release. The album also debuted in the AIR charts at #12 before breaking through into the top 10 to #6, remaining in the top 10 for over 6 weeks, a feat rarely achieved by a metal/hardcore band. Easily satiating the IKTPQ followers, this release serves to reaffirm IKTPQ\'s evolution, displaying how much they\'ve accomplished, the contribution they have made to underground music in Australia and the sheer distance they\'ve evolved over the course of their existence. <P>Not letting their location or personnel changes hinder their progress, I Killed The Prom Queen hastily reinforced their name at the forefront of the Australian hardcore and metal scenes with consistent timely touring. They recently traveled a myriad of kilometers throughout Australia with international acts including Canada\'s Silverstein, Sweden\'s The Haunted and USA metal act Exodus as well as playing with the likes of Fear Factory, Soilwork and Alexisonfire. Amongst countless supports, IKTPQ found time to wow Aussie crowds when they headlined the Australia wide `Destroy Music Tour\' over four long weeks before jumping on the plane to snowy Sweden to record the follow up to When Goodbye Means Forever. With festivals such as 2006 Come Together fesetival(Luna Park) & Overcranked festival, 2005 big day out and 2004 Hellfest (New Jersey USA) as well as several USA & UK tours under their belts, and with not one of the members over the age of 23, it seems IKTPQ\'s reign over the Australian and worldwide Metal and Hardcore scene is only just beginning! <P>Redefining Australian metal/hardcore with an intense live show matched by none and their unique mixture of hardcore and metal, IKTPQ more than deliver an experience not yet seen within Australia, or in the States for that matter. Their first full length release from Hand of Hope/Resist Records will force you to reconsider your perception of Australian underground music and discover why IKTPQ will continue to break the barriers and bring this underrated style of music to a broader and more mainstream audience. <P>The imminent release of their brutal new sophomore full length (set for release in June 06) recorded in Sweden with famed metal producer\'s Fredrik Nordstrom and Patrik J. Sten (In Flames, Soilwork, At the Gates) will see IKTPQ embark on a two month cd release tour of capitol and regional Australia followed by the boys jet-setting once again to unleash their album on the USA, UK, Europe, Japan and New Zealand.']"

Produced by Bow Wow\'s long-time collaborator Jermaine Dupri and featuring the American R&B superstar Chris Brown, \'Shortie Like Mine\' is blowing up nationwide hitting millions of radio listeners. Bow Wow whose film credits include \'Like Mike\' (one of the 50 Top Grossing films of 2002), \'All About The Benjamins\' (2003), \'Johnson Family Vacation\' (2004) and \'Roll Bounce\' -- may be seen in \'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\' as well as in an upcoming episode of \'Smallville.\' He is the youngest musician to open the Grammy Awards, is the first kid to be included in Vanity Fair\'s prestigious annual music issue (October 2001), and entered The Guinness Book of World Records as the youngest solo rapper to hit #1 on the U.S. charts. With numerous hit singles, platinum-plus albums, sold-out tours, starring roles in hit films, and a place in ""The Guinness Book of World Records"" already on his resume, Bow Wow continues to prove that he\'s the 100% real deal with the indisputable goods: a bona fide superstar blessed with talent, tenacity, and a deep connection to his audience.', 'Bow Wow opens his fifth CD, <i>The Price of Fame</i> with a solemn interview clip in which the rapper/actor discusses ""the mental breakdown dealing with the price of fame,"" thus setting the stage for a deeply emotive release. For a handful of tracks, he does exactly that, showing fans--and his competition-- just how refreshing that can be. The disc\'s first single, ""Shortie Like Mine,"" featuring fellow teen heartthrob Chris Brown finds Bow Wow spitting rapid-fire rhymes and embedding lyrical skills with his especially melodic rap style. ""Tell Me"" combines those same talents mixed with surprisingly candid subject matter: a plea to get his ex to come back to him. As he implores ""I\'m a whole different individual now/everybody but you invisible now"" to compelling back beats and samples (thanks to co-Executive Producer Jermaine Dupri), it feels like the pair could create a new genre: emo/electro/hip-hop. Dupri\'s amped-up hooks drive the disc, staying consistent while Bow Wow\'s identity oscillates between a lover and a wanna-be gangsta. Other songs worth noting are the hidden track, an R. Kelly duet dubbed ""I\'m a Flirt"" and the cheeky ""Damn Thing"" featuring Da Brat. On the downside, a number of tunes contain far too much thug posturing: ""Bet That,"" ""4 Corners"" (featuring Lil\' Wayne) and the 50 Cent-inflected ""On Fiya"" are filled with clichd car/money/thug lyrics, causing Bow Wow\'s uniqueness to get lost in the flow. <i>--Denise Sheppard</i>']"

Yet another Sloan serving of august and finely crafted rock, Never Hear the End of It is also thirty tracks long. You heard me. Thirty. From pop masterpieces like ""Who Taught You to Live Like That"" (which clocked the highest number of first week downloads in iTunes history upon its Canadian release), to the unforgettable ""Listen to the Radio,"" this album could, for any other band, be close to three perfect records. Throughout their critically lauded career (including a recent tour with The Rolling Stones), Sloan has managed to share songwriting duties between all members and never have a single change in line-up. Records like Never Hear the End of It are the reason Sloan have remained valid for so long.', 'Never before has a Sloan record generated such extreme reviews by critics and fans. The band\'s eighth studio recording, <i>Never Hear the End of It</i>, contains a whopping 30 songs on one disc, ranging from 50 seconds to just over five minutes in length. The bulk of those tracks average roughly two-and-a-half minutes and bleed into each other--at times rather abruptly. As a result, the disc feels like an eccentric art-project; even the strongest tracks prove to be more of an appetizer, leaving listeners longing for a main course. Stylistically, there are no surprises. The group\'s music tends to fall into Sloan\'s two traditional categories: Beatles-esque stylings or \'70s-influenced rock tunes. Noteworthy highlights include disc opener ""Flying High Again"" with its Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash harmonies, and the blisteringly old-school punk rock pacing of ""HFXNSHC."" Fans of this disc compare <i>Never</i>\'s nonstop onslaught of songs to Liz Phair\'s <i>Exile In Guyville</i> or the Clash\'s <i>Sandinista</i>, while naysayers find the short, fast melodies insufficient in length and substance.

The story is as if we would read it from a dead girl\'s diary. The girl has no name; she could be anyone, or no one at all... ""I imagined what would happen if someone would have a chance to see things in the afterlife. The girl was visited by an angel, who took her to the `Land Of Lights\'; where human souls go after their earthly lives. She had a pact with the angel: she must keep in secret all the things that she felt and saw there. When she was back in her bed again, she couldn\'t keep the secret and she whispered all the things to her sleeping boyfriend, she thought, she didn\'t break her oath in this way, because he didn\'t wake up. In the morning when they awoke, he told her about his \'strange dream\' in which she had told him about the angel, and the hope of an afterlife. He was sure that his mission was to spread the word to all people about `The Land of Lights\'. But people interpret faith in their own ways, sometimes for the worse, and all hell began breaking loose. I think everyone will find something in this story that is about the human selfishness, blind faith, the pain of helplessness, the pang of conscience...the pain if you lose someone."" <P>Limited digipak in the USA, Weblinks for bonus video, mp3s and expanded booklet.', 'It is the realm of progressive magic, and they prove once again that they are the masters of it. --<i>progarchives.com</i>']"

With guest appearances by Rosanne Cash, Joan Osborne, Levon Helm and more, STATE OF GRACE also includes their soul-stirring re-invention of ""(What\'s So Funny \'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding?"".', 'Elvis Costello made Nick Lowe\'s ""(What\'s So Funny \'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding?"" a hard-put question--the Holmes Brothers transform it into a prayer on their spare, passionate tenth album. The disc earns its title by gently framing a clutch of originals and well-chosen covers within their signature blend of old-time gospel singing and roadhouse blues. And zydeco: they transport CCR\'s ""Bad Moon Rising"" from the mythic swamps of California songwriter John Fogerty to the authentic bayous of southern Louisiana with an accordion-led arrangement and two-step rhythm. Although these New York City-based juke joint veterans are an electric band, this time out producer Craig Street has surrounded the velvet and grit of their three-part harmonies with acoustic instruments and relaxed tempos. The uncluttered setting magnifies every nuance of their singing, making many of these performances absolutely angelic. And the simpler the better. Their slow, wistful piano-accompanied version of Cheap Trick\'s ""I Want You to Want Me"" aches with desire and sadness. Wendell Holmes and Rosanne Cash bare the wounded soul of Hank Williams\'s ""I Can\'t Help It If I\'m Still in Love with You"" as they trade verses over acoustic guitars and mandolins. Joan Osborne and Levon Helm contribute guest vocal on other songs, but it\'s the Brothers\' organic union of the spiritual and the corporeal that makes this album so lovely and so thrilling. <i>--Ted Drozdowski</i>']"

Where have these guys been all my life?......Must....Hear....More."" -- <i>Stomp & Stammer - Jeff Clark</i>', 'Warm In the Wake\'s Chris Rowell on the songs of ""Gold Dust Trail:"" <P>1. ""Tame Thoughts""-This one probably makes the top of the list of songs with sparkly, space stuff added with all of the synths.... We were living downtown and going out to all of these places downtown in Atlanta and everyone, all the twenty-something\'s, were vying for each other every which way every evening... and I guess I started thinking really hard about pheromones, instinct, morals and so on... this one came from a whole lotta lust. Yes you are an accountant, or an engineer, or whatever by day, but in the night you may be any number of zoo animals. <P>2. ""Hearts vs. Heads""-Your head messes with what is in your heart everyday. I lived in Asheville NC for a while and maybe this fell out of the Saturday bluegrass show on WNCW....I have a cricket box that is 80 years old and still used when we go fishing...We hope someone gives this song to someone else 80 years from now. <P>3. ""Golden Inhibition Destroyer""-Jet fuel used to remove the Tame thoughts.....and wicked, transcendent piano by Dan. Probably my favorite piano solo he\'s done to date. Probably our favorite song to play live. 4. ""Good King""-Nature vs. nurture thing happening again here. I had a teacher who was a self-proclaimed anarchist. I always thought that was the craziest thing to find this older responsible guy in Birmingham calling for anarchy. And then comes along George W and now I understand him a little more... but who can blame George? He\'s only a tiny little human. Eating processed chicken, playing guitar while New Orleans is destroyed, keeping track of what\'s nuclear- just like you and me. <P>5. ""What You Seek""-Amazing huge guitar Adam tracked to make the chorus bigger when we were mixing in Brooklyn. The only song I\'ve ever recorded with a Les Paul. When this was put together, I guess we were all kind of stuck on giant, sea-faring vessels of the 1800\'s- and a good friend in trouble. So we wanted to make this one ocean-sized. <P>6. ""Ironworker""-I worked in an iron foundry in Birmingham that was later the subject of a full hour special on PBS Frontline due to employee safety abuses. At about the same time someone was trying to teach me about this French philosopher Foucault and his high-brow ""world prison"" models. I used to wonder what the guys working in the foundry would think about this Foucault fellow...then I would laugh. And then a vat of molten iron blew up next to me and I quit thinking about it until I wrote this song. Great chicken pickin\' on that pedal steel done by Paige Waldrop. <P>7. ""Skeleton Friend""-There are some tape loops of a thunderstorm on this one...everyone helped to make it sort of dark and lofty with keys and ghostly backwards guitars. I have a friend who I\'ve known since we were five and we sort of grew up going down to a Lake in south AL to a campground on the water. He was a completely normal kid, but over the years he became really, really mentally ill and withdrawn...until he sort of quit talking at all. So there you go.']"

As unusual as it may be for the celebrated trumpeter to present himself as a kind of soap box rapper, underwhelmingly taking aim at ""supercapitalists,"" liberals, and rappers alike, the most notable departure here is his prominent feature of a vocalist, young Jennifer Sanon. A winner of the Essentially Ellington high school competition, she has real appeal and is smart, silky-toned, and calmly assured beyond her 21 years. The influence of the mighty Abbey Lincoln is felt in both the directness of her delivery and the soulful expansiveness of the music, performed by a quintet. Though Marsalis gets his time in the spotlight, playing with brittle strength as well as his customary warmth, he is generous in shining a spotlight on his bandmates, including a pair of talented up-and-comers in pianist Dan Nimmer and bassist Carlos Henriquez, drummer Ali Jackson, Jr. and saxophonist Walter Blanding, who, 15 years after being introduced on the ""Tough Young Tenors"" album and in spite of his stellar contributions to Marsalis\' Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, doesn\'t get the attention he should. <i>--Lloyd Sachs</i>']"

Their last three releases came in 2004 in the form of two singles and an album. Two and a half years have passed and now the wait is almost over. Assemblage 23 is proud to announce the release of the Binary single. Featuring three versions of the title track along with two b-sides, the new single shows a new found maturity in structure and songwriting. ""Binary"" exhibits intricate and interesting musical sequences overlaid with Tom Shear\'s easily discernable vocals and hard-hitting beats. One of the major highlights alongside the Nerve Filter remix of the title track is the incredible b-side, ""Dirt,"" which could easily have been a single all its own. As a precursor single to the new album Meta, Binary hits the mark and blows right through it.', 'Tom Shear began constructing music at home under the moniker Man On A Stage in the late 1980\'s. Most of the music was very simplistic and poorly constructed, with no vocals at first but as time went on they occurred more often. While working on Man On A Stage, Tom Shear also was playing bass live for a punk-influenced band collectively known as the Advocates. In 1988 at a Depeche Mode concert, Assemblage 23 was born. Tom was amazed by the industrial dance music that the opening DJ was spinning. His love of the electronic synth-pop sounds mixed with heavier darker aggression proved to be an turning point for him. While in college, in addition to working on Assemblage 23 non-stop, Shear also collaborated with two friends, Mike Ukstins and Matt Guenette on a synth-pop project, Procession. The band didn\'t last long, but provided Shear with performance experience and practice. In 1992, he self-released a collection of songs called ""Wires"". Several radio stations began playing the new act, and fledging magazines, such as Industrial Nation, began to show interest. But it was a side project of Shear\'s called Nerve Filter that helped Assemblage 23 get some much needed recognition. On a whim, Shear sent copies of Assemblage 23 and Nerve Filter to Peter Stone of Xorcist, who in return handed them over to Don Blanchard of the now defunct 21st Circuitry Records. However, Blanchard\'s interest was not in Assemblage 23 but in Nerve Filter, although, a few Assemblage 23 tracks would later be released on several compilations. Arts Industria released the first \'official\' Assemblage 23 song ""Graverobber"" on their Construction No. 009 compilation. Several more times Shear sent out demos to various labels, and even while being frustrated by the lack of interest, he still wrote more Assemblage 23 songs. Finally in 1998, the Canadian label, Gashed Records signed Assemblage 23 and released their first album, Contempt in 1999, and the follow-up, Failure in 2001. Shortly after the release of Failure, Assemblage 23 had a falling out with Gashed Records and left the label to sign with Metropolis Records, who later that year re-released both Contempt and Failure. With only those two albums, Contempt and Failure, Assemblage 23 became one of the biggest names in industrial and EBM music today. To further the American electro act\'s success, a third album, Defiance, was completed for October 2002. Defiance pushed Assemblage 23\'s sound to the limits of only the imagination. Signature melody constructions, driving rhythms, non-stop beats, and highly emotional and personal lyrics made Defiance a logical follow-up to the widely reveled Failure.']"

Nothing sounds quite like their raw, unflinching music, which has amassed a large and loyal cult following over the years. One of the most critically acclaimed alternative bands of the'90s, the Whigs originally formed in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1986. An early self-released LP led to a multi-album deal with Seattle-based indie Sub Pop, and their riveting 1990 release for that label is where this compilation their first begins. It follows the Afghan Whigs through their Elektra and Columbia output, and also features two new and previously unreleased tracks recorded by the reunited group in 2006. It's an extraordinary portrait of one of American rock's most distinctive bands."", 'For all Greg Dulli\'s earnestness and thorough self-deprecation, maybe he and the Afghan Whigs just showed up to the post-punk, soul-tinted party a little early. Beyond the nervy-edged guitar riffage of ""Retarded"" and Dulli\'s muted, growly vocal, there isn\'t a whole lot on this retrospective to suggest that the Whigs couldn\'t just appear in 2007 and be hugely popular. The big-guitar and piano combination on ""What Jail Is Like"" and Dulli\'s unmistakable <i>presence</i> as a singer rekindle the listener\'s desire that the Whigs get solidly beyond niche-level acceptance. Dulli\'s astringent lyrics are centrally important throughout the band\'s oeuvre and stand out here (witness the heartfelt vocal tug of ""Be Sweet"" get countered by the famous ""I got a dick for a brain"" line). The Whigs are believably radio-ready--especially after so many male singer/songwriters have confessed to so much on the FM dial. As for this 18-song collection, fans will quibble over song selections. What they\'ll agree on is that the two new tracks, ""Im a Soldier"" and ""Magazine,"" both slow(er) and groovy, could make great strides for a new Whigs\' era--which is apparently unlikely, given Dulli\'s commitment to the Twilight Singers. <i>--Andrew Bartlett</i>']"

It\'s an epic to behold. Matthew Ryan has wandered around the edges for years now. You get the feeling he doesn\'t care much for anything that resembles a hollow victory. He\'s clearly chosen the hard way. From major to small to indie labels to DIY and back again; he\'s continued to follow some stubborn compass that keeps him quietly searching for his version of perfect weather in a song. Looking more and more like a young John F. Kennedy, he may have found it. From A Late Night High Rise is a movie without film, it\'s a novel without a book. It\'s absolutely beautiful, precise and unflinching. It\'s music that glows like a city from high up in an airplane- first appearing alien, then blooming completely human. Shaken by the sentencing of his brother to 30 years in prison and the death of a dear friend, Ryan took to recording and writing songs on his Korg D16 Porta Studio to cope with his grief. ""Follow The Leader,"" ""Gone for Good,"" ""Love Is The Silencer,"" ""Victory Waltz"" and ""The Complete Family"" were all recorded at home. Those recordings were the seeds that would become From A Late Night High Rise. Eventually, Ryan took what he had to Neilson Hubbard\'s studio. At the time, Ryan and Hubbard were compatriots in a side-project called Strays Don\'t Sleep. It was there that Ryan and Hubbard sculpted and fine-tuned the sonic emotionalism that implores From A Late Night High Rise into such a cohesive thread. Other members of Strays Don\'t Sleep came in from to time to contribute as well - Brian Bequette offered some of his signature distorted beauty on guitar, while Steve Latanation and Billy Mercer (Strays Don\'t Sleep\'s rhythm section) brought their rock and rumble to tracks that begged for something a bit more desperate (most notably: ""Misundercould"" and ""Love Is The Silencer""). Ryan recruited Kate York to be the heroine to speak; she had contributed beautifully to the Ryan penned and sung Strays Don\'t Sleep underground hit ""For Blue Skies."" Since these songs were of the same cloth, Ryan wanted York to play the female lead again. And York\'s voice delivers here with an ease and resonance that is masterful. In many ways From A Late Night High Rise is a song cycle, or dare I say, a concept record. But like all great stories it blurs around the edges and deals in an intimate universality that allows for interpretation. The ""I"" and the ""You"" in these songs become anyone, maybe even everyone. It goes from bravely autobiographical (particularly in the spoken word cinema of ""The Complete Family""), to beautifully impressionistic (""Everybody Always Leaves"") without ever interrupting its flow. Even a cover of Grant McClennan and Steven Kilby\'s sublime ""Providence"" eases by like a sibling to Ryan\'s compositions. All the more amazing is how the music forms an arc along with the story. From lush, precise arrangements to DIY utilitarianism, nothing interrupts the story. It\'s impossible to distill such a cohesive rumination on mortality and morality for you. Give From A Late Night High Rise a focused listen. Let it wash over you, follow the story like you would a great movie\'s plot, and be surprised by the hard-won beauty and optimism that the ending offers.']"

Here he\'s complemented by an amazing group--drummer Joey Baron, bassist Marc Johnson, and violinist Mark Feldman--for the third time. Though busy in a number of different contexts, the group members are wholly in sync with Abercrombie\'s vision, leaving plenty of space for the music to breath, prodding when it lingers, and generally adding elegant accompaniment throughout. The group is almost tango-like in its ability to build songs passionately through tasteful restraint. Of the ten tunes here, takes on Ornette Coleman\'s ""Round Trip"" and Bill Evans\'s ""Epilogue"" are telling signposts of influence, but this is a band that presses on, creating beautiful music that lives in the here and now. --<i>Tad Hendrickson</i>']"

Make no mistake, though: Gilberto\'s vocal work is a thing of beauty. She again blends bossa nova, samba, pop and electronica flourishes, but no one genre overpowers any other. Liliting guitars give way to pulsing percussion and horns, which crash against loops and samples. Gilberto coos amid the catchy club flavor of ""Bring Back the Love,"" and the moonlit ""Close to You"" recalls Sade. The daughter of Brazilian guitarist Joao Gilberto even tackles Cole Porter\'s ""Night and Day,"" recasting it as a hushed moment of bossa loveliness.

This recording uses the Nowak from 1886. Bruckner himself nicknamed this symphony ""The Romantic."" Its 1881 premiere marked his first Viennese triumph; it remains his most popular symphony, despite its occasional repetitiousness and moments when grandeur becomes grandiosity. As always, the spirit of Wagner hovers over the harmonies and the orchestration. The solemn processionals and chorales reveal the devout Catholic, while the sonorities and the frequent rests and pauses recall the organist resetting his stops. The Symphony abounds with long, arching melodies - somber and prayerful, soaring and ecstatic - and innumerable climaxes, often aborted but gathering for the final triumph. The incomparable Berlin Philharmonic revels in the glorious orchestral sound, from each individual solo to the massed tuttis. The performance is immensely exciting, expressive, and evocative. The only flaw is the excessive dynamic contrast; keep a finger on the volume-control. <i>--Edith Eisler</i>']"

Appropriately, given its title, several of the songs on Oranges and Lemons deal with Andy Partridge\'s newly acquired parental status (the jazzy ""Pink Thing"" is a cunning double-entendre about fatherly pride and his penis) as well as wryly address the wider failings of the world into which our children are born. Yes, like some sherberty, fructose-flavored lozenge, Oranges and Lemons is both bitter and sweet. But unquestionably excellent, as witnessed by the Byrds-like village-idiot love song ""Mayor of Simpleton"" and other highlights like ""King for a Day"" and ""Poor Skeleton Steps Out.""

Heralded by Billboard Magazine as ""one of the best of a new breed of singer-songwriters in Texas and beyond,"" Robison\'s work has garnered fans from all over who appreciate his reputation for writing emotionally complex songs - the kind of songs that send mainstream country stars like Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw, the Dixie Chicks and Lee Ann Womack running to the studio. Robison has penned numerous Number 1 and Top 10 hits, including ""Travelin\' Soldier"" by the Dixie Chicks, ""Angry All The Time"" by Tim McGraw with Faith Hill, and ""Desperately"" by George Strait. This is Robison\'s seventh release.', 'From the childlike collage on the cover to the silly title to the short length, Bruce Robison\'s fourth album looks to be his slightest. But look and listen again. The pleasure that he and his steady Austin band--featuring a grip-tight rhythm section of George Reiff and Eddie Cantu and the twangy garage flair of guitarist Andrew Nafziger--take in playing together only underscores how they serve an unfalteringly strong, varied set of Robison originals. Opening with the roller-rink, go-go bop of the title track, an homage to the Sir Douglas Quintet, Robison sounds loose and alive. He sinks his soul into detailed family memories and travels on ""When It Rains,"" a story song as wise and engrossing as any Guy Clark epic, while ""My Baby Now,"" with its piano, strings, and Southern melancholy, sounds like a lost Randy Newman ballad. His catchiest tune, ""Lifeline,"" with grand pop chorus, skipping rhythm, and harmonies from wife Kelly Willis, sounds like a future hit for a more glamorous country star. The band stretches out on ""Anywhere But Here,"" rising through a good guitar and mandolin groove and then quietly closing the album with ""23A,"" a love letter to those simple, enduring songs of ""love and hope, laughter and tears,"" the kind passed around at the end of a long honky-tonk night. No songwriter working the borders of country and Americana writes them better than Robison. <i>--Roy Kasten</i>']"

He\'s already shown that he can bash out three albums in one year--not to mention the hilarious fake hip-hop records posted for free on his Web site--and that he can sound as much like the Grateful Dead as he wants to in his constant subsequent touring. Backed once again by the Cardinals, Adams synthesizes and refines his approach to smooth, gorgeous country-pop. ""Tears of Gold"" is one of the best songs he\'s written in ages, while ""Two"" is a slowly percolating, sweet little number that recalls Sean Hayes in its soulful folksiness (someone named Sheryl Crow accompanies Adams on vocals). One of the greatest treats of this languorous, twangy album is the subtle ways that genre gets played with. ""I Taught Myself How to Grow Old"" is the best <i>Harvest</i> outtake Neil Young never wrote, while the treated, synth-sounding guitar solo on the druggy, chooglin\' ""Halloweenhead"" sounds like it comes straight out of Journey. And ""The Sun Also Sets"" sounds more than a little like Rufus Wainwright covering Fred McDowell\'s ""Write Me a Few of Your Lines."" It bursts with enough melodrama as to border on musical theater. But, as is clear on these songs of love and loss, Adams has always been at his best when giving into his most mellow, dramatic side. <i>--Mike McGonigal</i>', '']"

B000PKG5EK,A3NFGH2WJHKLYR,1,1367193600,Bartered Bride,Rudolf Kempe,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Classical']","['Living at a time of political upheaval, Bedrich Smetana (1824-1884) was caught up in the European nationalist movement and became the first nationalist Czech composer; his most famous work is ""M&#225 vl&#225st"" (My Homeland). Of his six operas, three celebrate patriotic heroes, three, Bohemian village life; among the latter is the ""Bartered Bride,"" his best known opera and surely one of the most delightful ever written. The story recounts the triumph of true love over the threat of a forced marriage, arranged by that icon of country life: the marriage broker. These matchmakers created connections between the marriageable youth of distant villages; originally respected and esteemed as shrewd judges of character, they gradually succumbed to greed and ambition and became popular laughing-stocks. Smetana and his librettist Karel Sabina depict their broker as an arrogant, overbearing, money-obsessed blusterer brought down by a young lover\'s wily ingenuity. Comedy is tinged by pathos when the prospective bridegroom turns out to be a dimwitted stutterer; Smetana makes him an object not of fun but pity. The music is irresistible, full of heartfelt lyricism, tenderness and humor; though it harbors Wagnerian influences like motives recurring at crucial points, the folksong-like simplicity of its beguiling melodies and the idiomatic rhythms of its dances (often heard in concert) reveal its Czech roots. The reason that Smetana\'s other operas have been so sadly neglected is undoubtedly linguistic rather than musical: Czech is a language not widely used and very difficult to translate (for example, ""yes"" is a two-syllable word). This opera\'s Czech title literally means ""The Sold Bride,"" which sounds bad in English, but not in German, so Max Kalbeck\'s translation, used in this 1963 recording, retains it. The re-issue is remarkably good; there are a few cuts, perhaps to accommodate the old LP format. The performance is wonderful: Lorengar and Wunderlich are fabulous, Frick is properly comic but often not properly on pitch. Among the minor roles, Mercker stands out. The orchestral playing is excellent, brilliant, clear, expressive and idiomatic. <i>--Edith Eisler</i>']"

The common line on 60's soul albums is that after you get past the hit, the rest is pure filler.

Super OG lyrical great Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound fame has just done that on Digital Smoke, his debut collaborative album with J. Wells, a producer and rapper primed for superstardom. <P>J. Wells, a member of the Likwit Crew (King Tee, Tha Alkaholiks, others), toured with Tha Alkaholiks in 2001. While on the road, he and Kurupt bonded over J. Wells\' diverse production. The friendship and mutual respect resulted in what would become Digital Smoke (released on J. Wells\' Bonzi Records, through Fontana), a well-rounded project that displays J. Wells\' stellar production and vivid rhymes, as well as Kurupt\'s always potent rhymes. Impressed with J. Wells\' sonic output and his work ethic, J-Ro offered him a place in the highly regarded Likwit Crew. J-Ro then enlisted J. Wells to compile a mixtape for his Wolfpac Records. That release, J. Wells Presents: The Wolfpac Mixtape, became one of the West Coast\'s most revered mixtapes of all time thanks to its fiery performance from Tha Liks, Kurupt, Roscoe and others. <P>By this time, Kurupt had long been established as one of the most important and respected rappers. His work with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg helped usher in Death Row\'s music industry dominance in the early 1990s, and Tha Dogg Pound, his group with partner-in-rhyme Daz Dillinger, is regarded as one of the best groups in rap history. <P>So when J. Wells and Kurupt toured together, game recognized game and the two became quick friends and collaborators. In 2005, J. Wells enlisted Kurupt to appear on his highly regarded Digital Master album, a collection released on J. Wells\' Bonzi Records that also featured Method Man, Aftermath Entertainment\'s Bishop Lamont and Tha Liks, among others. And now, with Digital Smoke, Kurupt and J. Wells have instantly established themselves as rap\'s next great one-two punch. ""It\'s just a chemistry,"" Kurupt says. ""J. Wells is my lil homie and I\'ve been messing with him. He\'s got those hammer beats. He had an idea to do this album and I supported him. We made some good West Coast music.""']"

Anthems, hooligan choruses, big guitars, brass, a smattering of Psychobilly and, as usual, shed-loads of words. Glory Bumps has a curious tangential relationship with Barry Andrews' and Martyn Barker's recent improvised album Monstrance, a collaboration with XTC's Andy Partridge - Glory Bumps uses a number of loops created from the Monstrance album ['because they were there'] as well as Martyn's inimitable live drums and real-time guitar contributions from Andy. However there is no doubt that this is a Shriekback album 100% - as you will hear Wendy Partridge who has sung backing vocals on every Shriekback album since 1986 features as does Barry's son Finn Andrews (of The Veils) who lends his intense vocals to the happy-clappy title track.

In classic Gourds fashion the Mussel Shoals rekindling of ""How Will You Shine"" rides shotgun with the honky-soul of ""Moon Gone Down,"" but on Noble Creatures it\'s Russell\'s ballads that mark the album as an epaulet on the shoulder of an already mighty career. ""Promenade"" soars with a from-the-gut tale of squandered happiness and courses with Danko-like emotion.

The Gourds, perennially unpredictable, include several gorgeous, slower tunes here, from the plaintive ""Steeple Full of Swallows"" to the sashaying ""Moon Gone Down,"" and the aching ""Last Letters."" But these Texans are old-school itinerants, invoking wide-prarie country and Cajun and sloppy bar-room cow punk in equal measures--witness the Tom Waits-tinged ""Dr. Spivey"" for one growly-blues, off-center example. Jimmy Smith\'s ""A Few Extra Kilos"" plays on the boozy, aging-body refrain of ""spillage in the morning and again in the night,"" a mid-tempo paean to the torso expanding beyond its younger self. For the high-stepping, up-kicking Cajun touches, Smith steps back up to the mic for ""All in the Pack"" and Russell throws in the potentially politically incorrect ""Cranky Mulatto,"" all of which is grand.

Live, the quintet aspires to reclaim electronic music from the DJs and electroclash artists who simply plug in a DAT or a laptop for a show. The fight for decent electronic pop music is being fought in the trenches, and bands like Soviet are winning the battle one live show at a time. --Charlie Amter, Miami New Times<br /><br />You won\'t find a bad song per se of the 12 on We Are Eyes, We Are Builders, Beginning with ""Commute"", a cold, angular number that seems to have gears, the Soviet thesis becomes clear: technological isolation, urban alienation, and electronic relation, all communicated through digitized noises and high-speed rhythms that would have sounded ahead of their time twenty years ago. Keith Ruggiero\'s vocals affect a future-shocked automation, while the instrumentation buzzes with laptop loops, mechanized drum beats, and synth, synth, synth. ""Commute"" slides seamlessly into the danceable curiosity of ""Circuit Love"", which then rides into the album\'s two ""singles"" -- ""Marbleyezed"" and ""Candy Girl"". All three are robotic odes to passion -- like love songs two computers might write to one another -- and manage to be simultaneously dispassionate and saccharine. Yes, Soviet has done something amazing here -- created an album that sounds so much like something loveable, while managing to deliver it in a way that\'s absolutely mundane. --Devon Powers, Pop Matters<br /><br />Soviet s music really is positive. From songs like the poppy Candy Girl to the synthetically ambient China there s an innocent, disquiet about We Are Eyes, We Are Builders. It s as if the members of Soviet are musically inclined children and synthesizers are their new toys. If you ignore the media and just sit down and listen to it you come to realize this album is exciting and really well made. For some unknown reason this genre of music up and disappeared at the dawn of the 1990 s and over a decade later Soviet are picking up the torch. They wear their synthesizers on their sleeves like a badge of honor. If you stop and think about it Ruggiero and his band mates have real balls to play this sort of music in such a guitar saturated musical atmosphere. The reality of being a synth band while acts like the Hives and the Strokes are receiving radio air play twenty-four hours a day doesn t make Soviet s job any easier. We re still hearing garage rock from the sixties in every single band that has come out, notes Ruggiero. All the rock bands sound like a band straight out of 67. It just seems to be more accepted but the minute you pick up a synthesizer it s a real fight to be taken seriously. --Marcus Kagler, Under The Radar']"

Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.</i>"", 'Described by Time Out New York as ""lush, jaunty, and smooth,"" this Brooklyn-based pop band produces melodic, well-crafted pop based around Cohan\'s witty and thoughtful lyrics and Highstone\'s airy harmonies, reminiscent of Isobel Campbell and Tracey Thorn. Their influences range from little-known eighties bands from the UK (Prefab Sprout, Deacon Blue) to the more current sounds of pals Fountains of Wayne and New York\'s Candy Butchers. Critics have compared Tryst with Belle & Sebastian, Elliot Smith, and Aimee Mann; some new acoustic tunes carry suggestions of Divine Comedy and folksters Iron and Wine. The band\'s first EP, produced by Fountains\' Chris Collingwood and mixed by Ivys Andy Chase, was followed by regular performances on the New York pop scene including appearances at Joe McGinty\'s Loser\'s Lounge. The band then began to travel extensively, punctuated by return shows in NY (Mercury Lounge, Southpaw, Pianos, Sine); over three years the band played numerous shows in Paris, London, Dublin, and most recently, Tokyo. Tryst released their 2nd album, Kids of Big Stars, in December 2003. The album garnered significant rotation on college radio stations on the East Coast and Midwest, the praise and attention of indie press, and a growing audience from New York to Tokyo. June 2005 marks the release of Trysts third album, ""Hotel Two-Way"" (MH Records).']"

Guests Travis Tritt, Montgomery Gentry, and John Anderson add cameos, along with Waylon\'s wife Jessi Colter, who appears on four tracks. But this is Jennings\'s show, and although the country legend\'s health was on a downslide from which he would never recover, he sounds inspired and vital throughout this set of hits (and some obscurities). Extra tracks such as Tony Joe White\'s ""Trouble Man"" and the Band\'s ""The Weight"" are terrific additions, and the disc has now been reconfigured to follow the original sequence. Fans might lament the omission of signature Waylon fare such as ""Only Daddy That\'ll Walk the Line"" and ""Lonesome, On\'ry and Mean"" and the inclusion of fluffier pop like ""Never Been to Spain,"" but this remains a moving and exciting live recording. The DVD is an indispensable bonus. It shows Jennings\'s obvious delight playing with this exceptional 11-piece outfit and their enthusiasm working with a country legend.  The package is a fitting final document to one of roots music\'s most edgy trailblazers and essential listening/viewing for any country fan. <I>--Hal Horowitz</i>']"

B000S0H0S2,A2YTGRFQC9ZF52,1,1185235200,The Red Chord - Prey For Eyes,The Red Chord,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Alternative Rock', 'Hardcore & Punk', 'Hardcore']","[""THE RED CHORD made a giant leap from their debut release Fused Together in Revolving Doors to 2005's Clients, a leap that found the band moving from tiny clubs to the world's biggest metal stage as part of OZZFEST 2006. Fortunately the change in venue has not changed THE RED CHORD's core ethos of creating a highly disturbing, thought provoking grind/metal hybrid. Prey For Eyes pick ups where Clients left off, taking the bands brand on sonic mayhem to another level. However, unlike the Clients, Prey for Eyes is not a concept album. Inspired by actual people, events, dreams, books and loads of random thoughts, Prey for Eyes lyrically contains more twists, and turns all over the map, loaded with more imagination and curveballs than you can shake a stick at. Also unlike the two previous records, Prey for Eyes focuses far less on the negative aspects of everything and is an emotional, bipolar rollercoaster of double and triple meanings in every song, meant to provoke thoughts and free thinking. To that end, THE RED CHORD vocalist GUY KOZOWYK lends some insight to the title track, Inspired by events where my brother, who is a prison guard, walks in on an inmate doing something ridiculous in his cell. The prisoner won't talk and gets into this dialogue via a notepad. After documenting that he can no longer talk because the devil has removed his tongue, my brother checks the cons mouth with his flashlight. When he tells him that his tongue is definitely in tact, the inmate replies with the cryptic message Pray for Eyes."", 'The Red Chord engages a sensory onslaught with their new Metal Blade Release Prey for Eyes. A sprawling enigma, the album traverses nightmarish soundscapes with mind-bending time changes, gnashing guitars and schizophrenic vocals. Guitarist Mike ""Gunface"" Mckenzie couples bludgeoning riffs with haunting chord passages. Brad Fickeisen furiously propels the tracks with demonic double bass drumming as Greg Weeks bolts down a rhythmic freight train. Vocalist Guy Kozowyk is the ringmaster of this sonic horror show. His lyrics delve into the psyches of insane inmates, anarchist recluses and gods with a vengeance for pop music. This is dangerous and thought provoking music that transcends genres. This is Prey for Eyes. <P>The Red Chord have been crafting intriguing heavy music since their independent debut Fused Together in Revolving Doors in 2002. Combining elements of grindcore, death metal and hardcore, that release established them as one of the premier Massachusetts extreme metal acts. In 2005, Metal Blade released the follow-up Clients, a tortured concept album about mental patients, drug addicts, the homeless and the desperate and downtrodden. While they decimated crowds worldwide touring with the likes of Gwar, High On Fire, Between the Buried and Me, Unearth, Every Time I Die and Hatebreed, as well as stints on OZZfest 2006 and Sounds of the Underground 2005, ""Clients"" established The Red Chord as innovators in the burgeoning underground metal scene by staying away from the clich trappings that crippled some of their contemporaries. <P>In early 2007, the band began constructing Prey for Eyes with producer and engineer Eric Rachel (The Black Dahlia Murder, Atreyu) at Trax East. The record is an immense evolution from Clients. Guy states, ""Every song on the new album, for the most part, is a sketch of something that could probably take twenty minutes to explain. It\'s similar to Clients since every song has a backbone that could\'ve been a story. However, Clients was based on this closed environment where I was working. While writing this album, I was all over the world meeting people. So Prey for Eyes is based on dreams, conversations, books, random instances and occurrences. There was also a lot of different ground that I wanted to cover in terms of these weird, trippy dreamscapes and real crazy shit I\'ve thought of for a long time."" In order to tell these tales, Guy has also fine-tuned his voice like a weapon, destroying with an intelligible, distinct scream. <P>Heightening the dynamics of the record, Nate Newton from Converge guests on ""Tread on the Necks of Kings"" and ""Responsibles"", while Jonny Davy of Job For A Cowboy adds a distinct vocal madness to ""Pray for Eyes"" and ""Prevailed."" The guest appearances create a deadly vocal diversity, which compliments the intense fret work. Guy continues, ""We have a lot of mechanical changes, but Gunface was definitely hell-bent on throwing in these melodic soulful parts. The riffs can be incredibly abrasive and frightening, but they also have emotion, personality, soul and feel as well."" Add to that the intricate cover and packaging layout by Paul Romano (Mastodon, Chiodos, Through The Eyes of The Dead), and The Red Chord have a dangerous new record on their hands. <P>Ultimately, the stories remain central to Prey for Eyes. ""I don\'t want this to be one of those bands that will just be forgotten. I feel like I\'m a writer before a vocalist. My writing has always been pretty solid. With this genre, there\'s a lot of repetitive themes and material. I wanted to really break the mold on that. I just want this band to stand out and do something different, and I feel like we achieved that."" BY RICK FLORINO']"

As the follow-up to last year's critically acclaimed album The Animal Years, The Historical Conquests Of Josh Ritter is his most adventurous, fresh, and freewheeling work to date. <br>A first run, limited edition of The Historical Conquests Of Josh Ritter features an exclusive 4-track bonus CD. Available while supplies last."", 'You\'re presently reading about what may be the best album of 2007, hands down, by the most under-accorded American musical genius. Real murmurs, believable ones, came with Josh Ritter\'s 2006 album, <i>Animal Year</I>, suggesting that the Idahoan is today\'s Bruce Springsteen, today\'s Bob Dylan. He\'s never sounded more the part than on <i>Historical Conquests</i>, the follow-up to <i>Animal</i>. Ritter\'s tripping over his syllables and allusions on the opener, ""To the Dogs or Whoever,"" dropping biblical and historical images like a fresh-faced Dylan. Except here, Ritter throws in an organ-fueled, ride-cymbal-crashing, drum-hefty clatter. It\'s majestic, and it\'s only the first three minutes. Recorded between stints on a never-ending tour, <i>Historical</i> reflects Ritter on the road, quick witted, a master of phraseology and of imagery. Horns show up as color, giving Ritter a soulful vibe on ""Right Moves,"" a raucous funkiness on ""Rumors,"" and a doleful cloudiness on ""The Temptation of Adam."" More than anything, Ritter here lays claim to absolute singularity--yes, colored by Dylan and Bruce but simultaneously enlivened by something magical and simple and gorgeous. <i>--Andrew Bartlett</i>']"

STOKOWSKI WAGNER,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Classical', 'Symphonies']","['When Leopold Stokowski began his conducting career, the music of Wagner featured in his very first concert and was to remain close to his heart for the rest of his life. In those early days, particularly through gramophone records, he introduced Wagner to', 'If you disapprove of extracting ""bleeding chunks"" from Wagner\'s operas, blame the composer, who was the first to undertake the practice. His conductor-followers have accepted the custom with enthusiasm, none more than Leopold Stokowski who even concocted what were called ""Symphonic Syntheses"" (Charles O\'Connell, the Victor A&R man who produced Stokowski\'s Philadelphia Orchestra recordings during the 1930s, claimed credit for coining the phrase). While I expect that most conductors prefer to make their own arrangements, a few keepers of the flame have made modern recordings of Stokowski\'s Wagner arrangements. Among them is Jos Serebrier, former Stokowski associate conductor, and Charles Gerhardt, a former recording engineer and producer, whose conducting ambitions were encouraged by Stokowski. Wolfgang Sawallisch, one of Stokowski\'s successors in Philadelphia, recorded a group of the maestro\'s many Bach transcriptions. <P>Stokowski recorded his Parsifal synthesis three times--with the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1934, ""His"" Symphony Orchestra in 1952, and the Houston Symphony Orchestra in 1959. The Philadelphia performance has a three-minute cut; the Houston recording is in stereo. Serebrier takes a faster tempo in the Parsifal synthesis, which I think is to the music\'s benefit. Serebrier makes a splendid recording. <P>Many conductors, including Stokowski (he also recorded the Prelude to act III in 1961), have recorded the Prelude and Liebestod from Tristan und Isolde, treating them as a unit. In 1932, Stokowski recorded the Prelude and then followed it with some music from the rest of the opera, mostly acts II and III. He re-recorded this particular arrangement again with ""His"" Symphony Orchestra in 1950. That is the version used by both Bamert and Serebrier on their recordings. At that time, it was simply labeled ""Prelude--Liebesnacht--Liebestod."" In 1937, he recorded the ""Liebesnacht,"" beginning with part of the act II Prelude, abruptly concluding with the final bars of act II. This proved to be so unpopular that Victor eventually eliminated the Melot-Tristan duel and, with Stokowski\'s approval, tacked the Liebestod onto the end. In 1940, with the All-American orchestra, he returned to the Liebesnacht and retained the Liebestod ending (but cut the act II Prelude), calling it ""Love Music from acts II and III."" That title, with the Prelude to act II restored, was retained for his final recording of the ""synthesis,"" with the Philadelphia Orchestra, in 1960. That is a truly beautiful performance that, as far as I know, is now only available from the orchestra itself as part of a larger set in honor of its centennial. Although Serebrier uses the alternate arrangement (i.e., the one recorded by Stokowski in 1932 and 1950), the availability of his recording is something to be thankful for. It yields little to Stokowski performance wise and is blessed with superior sound. Serebrier\'s is relaxed and sensuous. He makes a few changes. Stokowski used to bridge the gap between the Prelude and the Liebesnacht with string tremolos--Serebrier simply pauses. I hear a brief gong roll leading into Mark\'s hunting horns and Serebrier, for some reason, adds trumpets to the mix. Among other conductors who have done more than the Prelude and Liebesnacht are Eugene Ormandy, who, to considerable effect, recorded his own ""Prelude--Liebesnacht--Liebestod"" in Philadelphia in 1952. Charles Gerhardt, with the National Symphony Orchestra (not the one in Washington) did a worthy performance of the ""Love Music from Acts II & III"" on a beautifully produced (by him) Chesky CD that also contains ""Wotan\'s Farewell and the Magic Fire Music"" in what is, basically, Stokowski\'s arrangement. Even if the performances were not as good as they are, the CD has sound to dream about. Then, there is Edo de Waart and the Netherlands Philharmonic performing more than an hour of Tristan without voices in, believe it or not, an imaginative arrangement by Henk de Vlieger, titled ""An Orchestral Passion."" If you should come upon this CD, do not judge it by its stupid cover art--if this sort of thing is your dish, it\'s quite delicious. <P>In 1931, Stokowski recorded 24 minutes worth of selections from Das Rheingold in what amounted to a ""symphonic synthesis"" but was not called by that name on the 78 album. I had the good fortune to hear this arrangement performed at a concert several years ago by the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra under Zdenek Macal. Later, in 1960 (using the voices of the Rheinmaidens) and 1966, he contented himself with ""The Entrance of the Gods into Valhalla."" So does Serebrier, whose slower pacing gives the music more weight and power than Stokowski. This is one case where I prefer the apprentice to the sorcerer. Ormandy made his own, longer and very effective arrangement of the ""Entrance,"" leading into it by poaching the section (inaccurately) called ""Wotan and Alberich descend into Nibelheim"" from Stokowski\'s arrangement. It is more accurately named ""The Invocation of Alberich"" on Ormandy\'s recording. I\'m sorry that Serebrier limits himself to the ""Magic Fire Music"" (as did Stokowski, on several recordings) instead of preceding it with ""Wotan\'s Farewell"" the way Stokowski did in 1934 (with Lawrence Tibbett as Wotan, so perhaps that one shouldn\'t count), 1947, with the New York Philharmonic, and 1960, with the Houston Symphony Orchestra. Stokowski made several recordings of the Ride of the Valkyries, including a 1960 one with Wagner\'s vocal parts. <P>Serebrier brings his Wagner-Stokowski collection to a triumphant conclusion with the Ride of the Valkyries. There are annotations worthy of the project by Edward Johnson and the conductor himself. - James Miller -- <i>Fanfare Magazine, February/March 2008</i><br /><br />Naxos has a good thing going in Jos Serebrier\'s traversal of the arrangements and &#34;symphonic syntheses&#34; of Bach, Mussorgsky, and now Wagner, by his mentor Leopold Stokowski. Like Stokowski himself, Serebrier has been able to put his own imprint on the orchestra (in this series, the Bournemouth SO), and he continues to show his respect by not trying to duplicate Stokowski\'s own famous recordings. Instead, he approaches the scores afresh, with the insights he has gained in his own long career -- as well as his meaningful association with the Great Man Himself. <P>The two &#34;symphonic syntheses&#34; here (the term was coined by Charles O\'Connell, himself a legendary figure in the recording industry, who produced Stokowski\'s Philadelphia recordings for Victor) are those of Tristan und Isolde and Act III of Parsifal. These are framed by the &#34;Entrance of the Gods into Valhalla,&#34; from Das Rheingold and the two orchestral numbers from Act III of Die Walkre. The &#34;Magic Fire Music&#34; is in Stokowski\'s own arrangement, while the Rheingold excerpt and the &#34;Ride of the Valkyries&#34; are his editions of the old Hermann Zumpe arrangements. <P>The spacious sound (Naxos has come a long way in this respect) conveys the full splendor of these performances, and Serebrier\'s annotation is, as always in this series, valuable in its own right. Here he specifies exactly which portions of the respective operas went into the &#34;syntheses,&#34; where Stokowski assigned a vocal line to an instrument and where he simply left it out, and various other details on how Stokowski achieved his remarkable, unique sound -- summing up, &#34;Some of it can be explained, but much of it can only be called magic.&#34; That about covers what happens here, too, in Serebrier\'s masterful, brilliant recording. -- <i>SoundStage!, December 2007</i><br /><br />Opulent Wagner arrangements provide a Stokowski stunner. It would be hard to imagine a more sumptuous disc. -- <i>Gramophone Magazine, Awards Issue, 2007</i><br /><br />Ravishing performances of Stokowski\'s sumptuous take on Wagner. Serebrier\'s view of Das Rheingold \'s final scene is gutsy and spectacular - out-Wagnering Wagner; and Stokowski\'s expressive Tristan symphonic synthesis accents all the lovers\' despair and ecstasy. The Liebesnacht is a lovely nocturnal evocation of trees swaying gently in the sylvan woodlands underlining the lovers\' awakening and mounting passion. Jos Serebrier invests a fragrant and voluptuous sensuality to match the unbridled passion of the celebrated Liebestod that follows where its mounting excitement is literally edge-of-the-seat stuff. -- <i>Music Web International, December 2007</i><br /><br />Recording of the Month: Ravishing performances of Stokowski\'s sumptuous take on Wagner. This album will undoubtedly figure in my list of outstanding releases for 2007. Don\'t miss this one. - by Ian Lace -- <i>MusicWeb International, October 2007</i><br /><br />Wagner: Symphonic Syntheses, arranged by Stokowski Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Jos Serebrier, conductor Naxos * * * * * Though enormously popular in the mid-20th century, conductor Leopold Stokowski\'s big-screen orchestral transcriptions later acquired a reputation as overblown. Happily, today many conductors are less puritanical and in recent years there have been several recordings of Stoky\'s delightful symphonic confections of Bach and other composers. Stokowski never conducted Wagner in the opera house, but was a committed advocate of his music, programming the German composer\'s familiar excerpts and crafting his own \'\'symphonic syntheses\'\' of Wagner operas. Compared to some of his flashy Bach arrangements, Stoky\'s Wagner is much less interventionist. With Tristan und Isolde he inserts the Lebensnacht section between the Prelude and Liebestod to form a more expansive symphonic poem, while also giving vocal lines to more solo instruments and sections. Elsewhere he merely doubles lines and beefs up brass and percussion for a more spectacular impact as with the Entrance of the Gods into Valhalla from Das Rheingold and the Magic Fire Music and Ride of the Valkyries . Jos Serebrier worked closely with Stokowski and this great conductor has a keenly informed yet not slavish sense of how to handle Stokowski\'s rich orchestral palette. He leads a resplendent Entrance of the Gods . The conductor also directs a spacious and majestic Tristan und Isolde synthesis, building seamlessly to a luxuriant climax. The Magic Fire Music is delightful and Ride of the Valkyries aptly rousing. Finest of all is the Parsifal synthesis. Surprisingly Stokowski\'s retooling excludes the Good Friday Music , instead taking the transformation section and final passage of Act 3. Jos Serebrier elicits a luminous, weighty and passionate reading, with atmospheric chimes and the Dresden Amen having great spiritual ardor. Recording is excellent and this CD is worth investigating for some extremely enjoyable music. In addition to conducting these gleaming performances, Jos Serebrier contributes his own insightful booklet note about Stokowski and the fabled ``Philadelphia Sound.\'\' A must have recording!

That the events populate a fairy-tale-like terrain is no small point. The transmutation of terror and dread into a manageable folkloric currency makes complete sense given the fantastic elements sewn within Orion's singular visions. As with the best fantasy tales, Orion's songs thread multiple meanings, some obvious, others occluded, through a linear narrative of disarming depth. All the while the tone is charged, with menace and beauty. This is classical music set to Lucio Fulci's the Beyond, folk music from some lost Balkan province where moonlight feeds all need for Vitamin D. Orion's text is a dark, rich blood that oozes through organs, infusing them with all manner of unearthy metastices; mutations which allow them to evolve through pain, survive the corruptions of this world and deliver upon it an inverse of the negativity it so often yields. Orion feels the world like few others can. Our reward for that is What I Want from You Is Sweet.""]"

Jon d says anything that even sounds like a sample was created with the intention of sounding that way by the Hooligans. To me, the beats to Somobe s debut album The Great Communication are competing with anything you hear anywhere else, and destroying most of it. Me, I m a lyrics type of dude. I love dope instrumentals, but if you have dope instrumentals and whack lyrics....I can t really listen for long. Luckily, Jon D brings it lyrically. It s no wonder the group decided to include the lyrics to the songs on their MySpace page. As I listened to an advance copy of The Great Communication I tried remembering lines Jon D spits, but every time I find one that stands out, I end up forgetting it because he kicks another one. Sometimes it seems Jon comes up with some of the cleverest stuff, other times, it seems as if he goes outside, and his pen traces life on paper in the form of rhymes. Doubt me? Check the MySpace fam, the track Building is what emceeing is about. Jon doesn t go to heavy on the punch lines and they don t come off forced, yet they definitely connect.

He first recorded for a few unestablished labels before moving on to Black Scorpio in the late 80\'s, where he recorded a few songs including his first 7"" single titled Caution credited to Mark Wander but really established himself in the late nineties with the single Sign of the Times issued out of the Netherlands on the Zola and Zola label. He s had 45\'s released on labels like Soljie, Jam Style and Tan-Yah ( Low Profile, the flipside of Garnett Silk s Retreat Wicked Man ) as well as Acoustic Vibes (for whom he is also a coproducer), B.I.G., Compa Music and Organic Records, and more recently Dill-Ox, Coppola, AL.TA.FA.AN., Bobby Digital, Special Delivery, Pow Pow, Addis and 321 Strong . His first album, Sign of the Times, is said to have stalled when the label declared bankruptcy. His second album, Jeremiah, featured cuts like Who Is To Be Blamed and Militant Soldier, but saw only limited release. His third album, Break The Ice, on Redbridge and Sound Proof saw only limited release. A passionate singer and dedicated songwriter, Mark offers roots music with a modern edge and is looking to build the movements even stronger and spread the vibes and the music worldwide on a more cultural and stronger vibration. Up to this time Mark has found his greatest success in Jamaica and Europe, partly because only one of his albums has made it into the U.S. Hopefully this release will help to change that as it gathers some of his best songs with various top Jamaican and European producers. In person Mark is dynamic, energetic, thoughtful and circumspect rooted in a Rasta world-view that brings an ancient message forward into modern times. On this solid outing Wonder unfolds the mystery and declares victory at last. With solid backing, tight production and old-fashioned talent and drive, Mark Wonder helps bring nurturing sustenance to a needy world. --Chuck Foster - Chuck Foster hosts Reggae Central on KPFK-LA (Los Angeles) and writes the Reggae Update column for Beat Magazine']"

The album, recorded live on New Year s Eve 2006 with tenor titan Joe Lovano, bassist Christian McBride, and drummer Jeff Tain Watts, is both a retrospective and a projective piece. While it features some of the compositions that have shaped Tyner s career, the album is a launch for Tyner s new label, McCoy Tyner Music, and will be the first among a series of three recordings that will be released within the next year. <br><br>Just over two years ago, Tyner was taken on as the first client of Blue Note Management, a division of the Blue Note Jazz Club. The success of this partnership lead to this release, which will be on the McCoy Tyner Music (MTM) label, created for him as an imprint of the Blue Note s in-house record label, Half Note Records. Upon listening, it is immediately apparent that Quartet features a working band and not just a gathering of four all-star musicians. Additionally, the record shows that Tyner, who now carries the torch as the only surviving member of the John Coltrane Quartet, is still at the top of his game as a composer, performer, and bandleader.', 'McCoy Tyner\'s work with the John Coltrane Quartet is well documented, and this CD marks a welcome return to that format. Recorded live at Yoshi\'s in Oakland, CA, over New Year\'s, Joe Lovano does the honors in the tenor sax chair, while bassist Christian McBride and drummer Jeff ""Tain"" Watts hold the rhythm section together with honor, passion, and drive. The world-class bassist and drummer, usually known for their overt showmanship and over the top chops, show remarkable restraint and sensitivity throughout. Tyner and friends play several of his original compositions, well-known and revered over the years. Lovano sounds, eerily enough, like Pharoah Sanders, employing a slightly staggered expansive vibrato on ""Walk Spirit, Talk Spirit,"" while using a more haunting stance  la Coltrane for ""Mellow Minor,"" a new modern mainstream tune. Sounding more like himself, Lovano and the group join a loping desert caravan for the beautiful ""Sama Layuca,"" with Lovano playing the part originally written for flute. They rip through ""Passion Dance"" and melt abject militarism during the poignant ballad ""Search for Peace."" Tyner, in character, utilizes a minimalist palette to extrapolate on improvisationally during his solos. After reported health problems, it is good to hear he is sounding quite inspired and energetic during the entire date. The happy song ""Blues on the Corner"" further cements his upbeat demeanor, while the finale/solo standard ""For All We Know"" is truly the real McCoy, replete with the many flourishes, dynamism, and harmonic colorations that distinguish him from all others. In many ways this is a remarkable date, a well-paced program with all the pieces (save ""For All We Know"") timed at around ten minutes, proof positive that Tyner\'s game is still very much on, and hovering at a very high level. --Michael G. Nastos - All Music Guide']"

It\'s tempting to wish that at least a few of these puzzling tunes could have fewer parts and to concentrate on the pleasant melodic elements more, or maybe just not switch back and forth between the piano-based songs and the guitar-based ones. But that\'s a bit like showing up at a MENSA party and complaining that folks are using too many big words; baroque, over-fashioned, and over-thought post-modern pop is what this duo does. On <i>Widow City</i>, the good-looking brother-sister team does it better than they ever have. This record\'s delightful and wholly original; no one else could possibly have made it.

When I take a solo, there s Frank Gambale answering me, like something you d hear on a gig. <br><br>Case in point: the Afro-Latin acoustic jazz tune Gambashwari. Sinewy guitar and piano chords/notes weave around one another in syncopated patterns, stating main, contra and counterpoint melodies. It s breezy, not cheesy, jazz -- the kind that possesses sophistication without being elitist, boring or unlistenable. It s utterly infectious jazz-fusion with aspirations toward chamber or classical music, with rock s reckless abandon simmering just under the surface. <br><br>Other tracks include, High Falutin Blues (an appropriate title for a song that crosses the boundaries of country, blues, and jazz), Like This (listen as Weckl locks into Patitucci s sparse bass line all the while commenting on Goodman s and T s jazzy/bluegrass-esque soloing acrobatics), and Teaser (a Chick Corea-style acoustic rocker, complete with trill-filled piano performances, blanketed by Weckl s silky stream of beats). Dave Weckl laid down some of the best drum tracks I ve heard in a while, Lavitz says. <br><br>Despite the obvious and some might say inevitable chops heard on this record, the high level of musicianship never detracts from the overall flow of the compositions. In fact, the record has a ring of newfound freedom; of a songwriter allowed to spread his compositional wings, which recalls the artistic creativity and motivation that drove Lavitz to create his 1986 solo debut, Storytime an album produced in the wake of a Dregs breakup. I am very excited about this, because not only did I get to write the bulk of the music, but I produced, played and played only acoustic, says Lavitz. While it has elements from other recordings I've done, it seems, at least to me, to stand out as being very different.""]"

Produced and recorded at his home studio in Manhattan, the record includes the single 'Alice' and features a variety of guest vocalists including the UK's MC Aynzli, Sylvia Gordon of Brooklyn indie-dance outfit Kudu, the Yoruba-speaking Nigerian 419 Crew, and Grandmaster Caz, one of the writers of the seminal Hip Hop anthem 'Rapper's Delight'."", 'After three albums that seemed to find Moby in some sort of creative stasis, <i>Last Night</i> sees the once-restless DJ/producer changing the record and returning to one of his first loves: the heaving dancefloors of his native New York.

""I Like to Move in Here"" shimmies along on a languid house beat that doffs a cap to early hip-hop in the shape of a cameo from MC Grandmaster Caz, one of the writers of ""Rapper\'s Delight"", while ""Everyday It\'s 1989"" is the sort of overdriven, ecstatic piano house that Moby perfected on his 1995 classic <i>Everything Is Wrong</i>. There\'s more guest spots in the shape of British MC Aynzli, the Nigerian 419 Squad and Sylvia from dark NYC disco band Kudu, but the most impressive thing about <i>Last Night</i> is the peaks that Moby can reach when he\'s working alone: see the grand, emotive swell of ""Sweet Apocalypse"", cold synths and driving beats that, were it released by James Murphy, would be hailed as genius--and rightfully, too.<i>--Louis Pattison</i>']"

The first two, ""Somewhere Along the Way"" and ""Walkin\' My Baby Back Home,"" were the biggest hits, both reaching number eight in Billboard. ""Because You\'re Mine,"" Cole\'s cover of the Mario Lanza movie song (done in a far more relaxed style than Lanza\'s, of course), was also a major hit, reaching number 16. ""Faith Can Move Mountains"" and ""The Ruby and the Pearl"" were somewhat less successful, but still lodged in the Top 30, as did the B-sides ""Funny (Not Much)"" and ""I\'m Never Satisfied."" The only one of the eight songs not to earn a chart placing was ""A Weaver of Dreams,"" the B-side of the single ""Wine, Women and Song."" In 1963, Capitol expanded Eight Top Pops into the 12"" LP Top Pops by adding two tracks at the end of either side of the original release. These four songs all came from an EP recorded by Cole in 1954, on which he covered hits by other performers, including Doris Day\'s ""If I Give My Heart to You,"" the De Castro Singers\' ""Teach Me Tonight,"" and Perry Como\'s ""Papa Loves Mambo."" In 2007, mail-order firm Collectors\' Choice Music reissued Top Pops with four more added tracks (thus doubling the length of the original Eight Top Pops album). They were rarities all recorded in 1952: the A-side single ""A Fool Was I,"" which hit number 17 in 1953; the non-charting single ""You Will Never Grow Old""; the B-side ""How (Do I Go About It?)""; and ""When I\'m Alone,"" which had never been released before in the U.S. (Except for ""A Fool Was I,"" these tracks were making their CD debuts.) On the various tracks, Cole addresses charts written by his conductors Les Baxter, Billy May, Nelson Riddle, and Pete Rugolo, varying the mood from lightly romantic to lightly melancholic, but always remaining as smooth a crooner as ever. ~ William Ruhlmann, All Music Guide']"

It's fair to say that nobody could have predicted the year to follow, one in which THIS WILL DESTROY YOU went from local heroes to international darlings. The phenomenon took hold shortly after a brief basement tour of the west coast with labelmates SPARROWS SWARM AND SING. After a fun trip filled with good times and surprisingly large audiences (this was their first time out of Texas), the band returned home, unknowingly settling into what would become the eye of the storm to follow. Reviews of the album began to pour in, all singing unanimous praise. Even Pitchfork liked it... inciting a scramble for the record at retail and online (the band became one of iTunes' top artists in 2007). This parlayed into the THIS WILL DESTROY YOU being name-checked in publications like Rolling Stone and ultimately being awarded '2006 Album Of The Year' by Rock Sound editor Darren Taylor. 2007 saw even more growth for the band, as their music started seeing placement in everything from skateboarding and paintball videos to cable networks (VH1, Fuel, MTV) to independent documentary films and even major studio films. In one of the most bizarre events possible, the music of THIS WILL DESTROY YOU was present during a high-profile briefing and presentation before the nation's top military brass inside the Pentagon (yes, THAT Pentagon) concerning the failed efforts of Hurricane Katrina. Meanwhile, the band stayed active on the live front, stealing the show at a sold-out SXSW showcase and accepting an invitation to tour the U.S. with soon-to-be-upstaged-every-single-night FEAR BEFORE THE MARCH OF FLAMES. <b>S/T</b> is the second album from THIS WILL DESTROY YOU, clocking in a 7 tracks and 52 minutes. Recorded and produced by John Congleton (EXPLOSIONS IN THE SKY, MODEST MOUSE, R. KELLY), it is a stunning and worthy follow-up to <b>Young Mountain</b>. Darker and seamlessly more dynamic and emotionally gripping than its predecessor, <b>S/T</b> is primed and ready to push their entire genre forward and continue to win the band hearts and minds across the planet. This is a landmark album by a band that will inevitably be mentioned in the same breath as MOGWAI and SIGUR ROS without hesitation. Dive in.""]"

The result can only be described as a living, breathing Arc of Passion. As one of the great pioneers of electronic music, Steve's career has many musical highpoints; Arc of Passion proves to be another definitive statement along the path. Advanced response from listeners places this album at the top of the long list of must-have releases from Steve s body of work. Steve reaches into his sonic palette to weave elements of his three definitive styles into a continuous, evolving flow. Rich harmonic chords, spiraling sequences and deep sky soundworlds move fluidly within this 2-hour set.<br>A vibrant immediacy is alive on Arc of Passion; the sonic textures and evolving nature of the pieces reach into the core of the present moment bringing it into form with elegance and energy.<br><br>The opening 19-minute track billows outwards with rich and shadowed harmonic movement; deep chords ebb and flow like the thunder clouds of a summer storm, entering the realm of the hauntingly serene Mystic Chords & Sacred Spaces or Magnificent Void albums. The set flows into the 60-minute title track built from layers of percussive and melodic patterns interwoven and evolving while holding a steady pulse and direction. Waves of emotion from intertwining sequencers provide the foundation for the evolving trance patterns that develop into full mesmerizing, passionate form. The closing 20-minute piece is deep primal ambience mixed with processed didgeridoo hovering within an expansive soundscape. Long, arching tendril-like forms breathe within this infinite soundfield.<br><br>&#34;This arc represents a trajectory of emotion infused with energy,&#34; Steve comments. Arc of Passion is a deep and vibrant expression of life lived passionately."", 'On the <em>Arc of Passion</em>, Steve Roach goes forward by casting back through his three decades of music making. As if focusing through a camera lens, he compresses the depth of field of his career across two CDs. This isn\'t a collection, but a reflection as Roach touches upon his older styles with a modern hand. On ""Moment of Grace,"" he references his classic album <em>Structures from Silence</em>, in a long excursion of slowly sweeping synthesizer layers that weave in and out of each other in translucent drifts. But like all of the three extended tracks on <em>Arc of Passion</em>, it begins in his past and moves into the present, in this case, darker soundpools like those heard on his 2006 series, <em>Immersion</em>. Roach built his reputation on this brand of soothing ""quiet music,"" but also on percolating, rhythmically driven sequencer pieces. That side appears on the hour long title track. As a work of clockwork mechanics, it\'s like being inside a pinball machine as rhythmic, interlocked sequences ping and stutter in elliptical orbits around each other. <em>Arc of Passion</em> concludes with ""Views Beyond"" by referencing the darker, non-rhythmic side of his techno tribal days with groaning didgeridoo merging into equally groaning synthesizers, tinged with electronic halos. In an era of quick hits and flash downloads, Steve Roach is still composing music on a grand and epic scale. -- <em>John Diliberto</em>']"

This album features the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.

She has an online journal of her life as a working classical violinist busy on the concert road. As Hilary puts it 'a nomadic musician - a modern troubadour'."", ""Few would argue that Sch&ouml;nberg's Violin Concerto makes for easy listening. Its angular expressions, weird, heavenly decoration and the long solos that seem designed to maim the violinist can be, simply, too much. Hilary Hahn, on this new CD, plays the work as if it were an outgrowth of Romanticism (which it is), rather than the start of a musical revolution (which it also was) and the result is lyrical, songlike, and, well, Romantic. Yes, the 12-tone thorniness is clear, but each melody makes sense not only within itself, but throughout the whole concerto. If the first movement puzzles, the Andante sounds practically like a Viennese Waltz and the finale is not only like a feat by a virtuoso, but a culmination. This is the most approachable performance of this work available. The Sibelius concerto gets a fine if unusual reading. Hahn plays it with a Nordic coolness; the first movement's long melodies have less passion than the listener will be accustomed to and even the finale, normally played with somewhat of a bellicose nature, comes off without much heat. But it certainly cannot be faulted as sheer gorgeous playing and neither can Esa-Pekka Salonen's accompaniments. -- <em>Robert Levine</em>""]"

Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.</i>"", ""Guitarist Frank Carillo's storied resume includes songwriting, recording, stints and jams with everyone from Led Zeppelin and Bad Company to Carly Simon, Twiggy and Golden Earring. Following up 2005's &#34;Bad Out There,&#34; &#34;Someday&#34; is about as good as Americana gets. And if there's such a thing as a classic American voice, Carillo's got it. With just enough Springsteen (Don Dixon?) grit, he reels off everyman stories (&#34;Lucky if You Can Breathe,&#34; &#34;The Blue Room&#34;) and plaintive boogie-ballads (&#34;Someday&#34;) with ease and lan. His songs are mature and tuneful, and he easily spins tales that conjure up vivid images: the opening &#34;Roll the Bones&#34; is an old-fashioned, minor-keyed tale of love and money while &#34;The Way Out&#34; offers timeless thoughts on life - and a fine guitar solo. On the punchy &#34;Somebody Poisoned the Well,&#34; Carillo's voice brings to mind UK pub rocker Graham Parker, while he adds an edge to the song with spot-on slide guitar. If the sound of '70s rock permeates the tracks (the twin leads on &#34;Don't Get Sammy Started&#34;) it has more to do with Carillo's old school honesty than any kind of contrived retro feel. --Michael Lipton - Charleston Gazette Charleston, WV - March 27, 2008<br /><br />Way back before I was a mere twinkle in the milkman s roving eye, Frank Carillo was writing songs about such milkmen types and their manly, cowboy adventures - roaming the free land, laying a hat down and calling it home etc etc. Fast forward thirty-five years to present day and he s at it again with his Bandoleros and their 2008 album Someday. This ll surely take your Dad back to his youth, or at least the youth he darn well wishes he d had. Let me paint you a picture; virile, Bourbon swilling man o the land , lives a rootless existence, (perhaps wakes up under desert sun with a sore head, a taste of blood in his mouth, next to a dehydrated horse), and sings in heartfelt biographical format about his current days in search for that sweet, small town girl he left behind. Though for all I may joke, it bodes well to recognise that Carillo is somewhat of a musical veteran and has made a career out of bluesy, country tales of (mid-life crisis) woe and this may be what you re looking for. He s well within his genre and if you re a little bit country , this album is a good choice, (and just a tip; Gotta Be You is a great one if you re planning a line dance). --Helen Foley-NRAC-Gateshead, England-March 14, 2008<br /><br />New Yorker Frank Carillo has been round the block a time or two. He's played guitar with Peter Frampton, toured with Tom Petty, written songs with Carly Simon and penned a hit for Joan Jett. He's appeared in a Meg Ryan movie, recorded with Golden Earring, toured with John Hammond, played sessions with Twiggy - and he just happens to number Led Zeppelin among his celebrity fans. Thirty years after his debut solo album, he's now playing rough and ready rock and roll with a bar-room band, and writing wordy songs that recall the early best of Bruce Springsteen, no less. Both Lucky If You Can Breathe and Somebody Poisoned The Well particularly nod to the Boss's Jersey jaunts, the latter a close cousin of Blinded By The Light with Carillo's gravelly vocal to the fore. Someday is joyous boogie driven by blues harp, acoustic and bottleneck guitars, while Don't Get Sammy Started does the same with the amps cranked up, just like Lowell George used to do. The rabble-rousing Everything Changes is something The Pogues would have a ball with, Gotta Be You is down and dirty rock'n'roll, and Eastern Time gives John Hiatt a run for his money. When he strips things back, The Way Out will delight anyone who was into Dire Straits when they were playing pubs, and final Glass Heroes is a fragile treat. This isn't fashionable or glamorous - just honest to goodness songwriting. Get acquainted with Someday soon. --Paul Cole - Sunday Mercury - Birmingham, England - February 14, 2008""]"

Lagos, Nigeria, 1974-1979: the funk & disco capital of West Africa. More nightclubs, bars, spots and dancefloors than any place along the coast from Dakar all the way to Kinshasa. Nigeria Disco Funk Special is an amazing collection of heavy dancefloor grooves from urban Lagos in the '70s -- hot and driving slices of funk, disco and boogie that show just how vibrant the music scene was in one of West Africa's most populous and culturally diverse cities. In the '70s, it wasn't just James Brown who influenced the musicians playing in the nightspots of Lagos -- the loose-structured and elongated jams that he was pioneering in America had been a part of Nigerian music much longer than that. This album is the sound of Cuban-heeled and micro-minied Lagos youth soaking up the sound of the American discotheque and putting their own inimitable twist on the proceedings. The CD and double gatefold vinyl include rare tracks from famous musicians like Bongos Ikwue & The Groovies and Mono Mono's Joni Haastrup, as well as selections from cult bands like Asiko Rock Group, SJOB Movement and Jay-U Experience.

The best of this collection (most of CD1) is luminous: very electronic, often rhythmical and melodic, always economical and making every sound count. These tracks are like no other jazz ensemble and, although recognisable as Ra who else could think of, and then get away with this unlike any other Ra ensemble either. Ra makes the machines do amazing, visionary things while the band exercises restraint, remaining always in focus. In between, there are piano, saxophone, trumpet and drum vignettes, fresh and perfectly judged; this real was a fine band.

The Door is distinguished by vaulting lyricism and clear-edged melodies, a strong sense of ambient space in the writing, and edge and excitement and openness to improvisation. The 28-year-old Norwegian cites Miles Davis, Clifford Brown, Kenny Wheeler, Tomasz Stanko, Arve Henriksen and Nils Petter Molvaer as influences upon his stylistic evolution as a soloist. However it was his own, meanwhile characteristic, sound that prompted the International Association of Jazz Educators (IAJE) to present him the International Jazz Award for New Talent in 2007. The prize included support for an international tour, allowing Eick and musicians to develop their repertoire. The Door was subsequently recorded in Oslo s Rainbow and Cabin Recorders studios in September 2007. Eick s spacious pieces allow plenty of free range for Jon Balke, whose resourcefulness as pianist, always taking the path less trodden, is in evidence throughout the album. Balke s playing, in a rare sideman role, is one of the pleasures of The Door. Orchestrator par excellence in presentations of his own music (particularly with Magnetic North), Balke the pianist is effectively an arranger-in-action here, continually opening up fresh perspectives inside Eick s robust ballads and mid-tempo pieces. Drummer Audun Kleive is another player with deep ECM roots. A former member of Terje Rypdal s Chasers and of Charles Lloyd s touring quartet, he has also had a long association with percussionist Marilyn Mazur. Here he in tandem with bassist Audun Erlien, (previously heard on ECM with Nils Petter Molvaer), developing and telescoping the grooves and pulses. Guest artist Stian Carstensen who appears on three tunes ( Cologne Blues , October and December ) was last heard on ECM playing accordion with Trygve Seim (Different Rivers) is here featured on pedal steel guitar, an instrument whose expressive potential is rarely glimpsed in jazz contexts.', ""Mathias Eick's resum includes work with musicians of many styles, from Chick Corea and the Trondheim Jazz Orchestra to Norwegian psychedelic rock band Motorpsycho. A primary project in the last ten years has been the jazz/progressive rock ten-piece band Jaga Jazzist: Eick's multi-instrumentalism has been an important part of that group's sound and on The Door he is also heard on vibraphone and guitar as well as trumpet, as he puts it, whatever needs to be played. Eick has appeared on two ECM recordings with Norwegian-American guitarist Jacob Young, Evening Falls and Sideways, and on Finnish harpist/pianist/composer Iro Haarla's Northbound. In 2007 he became a frontline soloist of Manu Katch's band, appearing on the best-selling Playground and touring extensively with the French/African drummer (more than seventy concerts scheduled in 2008. The Mathias Eick Quartet plays a launch concert for The Door in Stavanger (officially the cultural capital of Europe in 2008) on May 9.

My interest and intention was never to rearrange his music or to have mine sound like his, but to try to communicate the spirit and feel his music has, put to a jazz context. <br><br>Rounding out the CD are the florid, midtempo title track, the lithe and lilting Far Side, the ballad, In Passing, the Latin tinged Pine s Creek, and the rhythmically challenging Dave s Idea. There is also a bonus downloadable track Tag featuring Doug Yates incomparable bass clarinet solo. On all of the tracks Baum s warm-toned flute and alto flute are beautifully supported and counter-stated by the lickety-split rhythm section and the rich horn lines, signatured with supple, Gil Evans and Herbie Hancock/Speak Like a Child-like voicings.<br>Solace is the passport to all of the places and spaces of Jamie Baum s musical universe. Like most musicians, I am influenced by so many artists and styles ... I ve been fortunate to hear and play with many great musicians both in NYC and abroad...I m sure that they are all in here, somewhere.', ""Solace is a no-frills, 74-minute-long major statement by flutist, composer and arranger Jamie Baum. Its impressive centerpiece is her four-part &#34;Ives Suite,&#34; the first two parts - each titled &#34;Time Traveler&#34; - based on Charles Ives' &#34;Fourth Symphony,&#34; and parts three and four based on his &#34;The Unanswered Question.&#34; Baum wanted to &#34;communicate the spirit and feel his music has, put to a jazz context,&#34; and uses the tools that the iconoclastic Ives relied on in the early 20th century, such as polyphony, polyrhythms and dissonance. Part three, &#34;Questions Unanswered,&#34; is particularly striking, where Kyoko Kitamura's atonal vocalizing and then her chanting of the words &#34;misleading,&#34; &#34;unintended,&#34; &#34;blame&#34; and &#34;grey zone,&#34; in addition to recorded excerpts from speeches by President John F. Kennedy, all combine to form a powerful anti-war statement.<br><br>Baum's rich and fresh voicing for her longtime septet, whether playing melodies or in counterpoint, are most responsible for the laudable success of all the pieces on this CD. Her own flute, the trumpets of Ralph Alessi and Shane Endsley, the alto sax or bass clarinet of Douglas Yates, the French horns of Vincent Chancey and Chris Komer, and the rhythm section of pianist George Colligan, bassist Johannes Weidenmueller and drummer Jeff Hirshfield, are all utilized by Baum in endlessly imaginative and ingratiating ways. Baum's use of ostinatos for many arrangements of her compositions is also quite distinctive and effective. The soloists are notably inspired throughout. The flutist's tribute to Kenny Wheeler, &#34;Wheeler of Fortune,&#34; with its tone-rowed theme, is a standout, as are the convoluted, yearning &#34;Solace,&#34; the dirge-like ballad &#34;In Passing,&#34; and the light-hearted &#34;Pine Creek.&#34;<br>- Scott Albin --JazzTimes - July/August 2008<br /><br />When flautist/composer Jamie Baum releases a new album, many modern jazz aficionados take notice. With a core septet and others sitting in on various works, Baum pays homage to trumpeter/flugelhorn great Kenny Wheeler, and modern classicist Charles Ives. One of the many highlights of this set includes the Ives Suite, where she rearranges the composer's famous Unanswered Questions amid the four parts that are composed around his Fourth Symphony. Baum's uncanny ability to transpose dense, multi-tiered arrangements into mainstream, cutting-edge stylizations simply equates to highly entertaining form factor. <br><br>Baum professes the beauty of morphing interesting compositions with memorable hooks and a multitude of hues and shades. At times, these pieces convey a little big band vibe, partly due to a string of interweaving exchanges and seamless shifts in cadence. Here, trumpeter Ralph Alessi, saxophonist Douglas Yates, pianist George Colligan and others mix it up quite effectively. With the four-part Ives Suite, the ensemble integrates unusual harmonic components to parallel some of Ives' cutting-edge tonal frameworks. In effect, the suite is designed upon various movements that overlap and flourish via recurring sub-themes and stately horns choruses. Then, on In Passing, Baum's dark and moody flute lines are lucidly counterbalanced by bassist Johannes Weidenmueller's soul-searching solo jaunt. <br><br><br>Overall, the music iterated throughout this endeavor contains a potpourri of jazz-centric passages, spanning brash soloing spots and expansive motifs that conjoin via a domino-like thread. Baum's musical journey offers the drama and intensity of a cinematic thriller or cliffhanger, which is sure to keep her audience at the edge of their seats. <br><br>- Glenn Astarita --AllAboutjazz.com - Aug. 5, 2008""]"

Composed for the Arditti Quartet and premiered at the 1995 Holland Festival, it involves the four members of a string quartet playing in four different helicopters flying through the air. The music the quartet plays is then sent to a central space and mixed at a sound board. In his film Helicopter String Quartet, Frank Scheffer documents the complex preparations in the month leading up to the premiere of this work, as well as eliciting insights from the composer regarding how he conceived and executed it. Stockhausen tells Scheffer, for example, that the idea for the work came to him in a dream he had of musicians being able to fly. He then produced a fascinatingly original score in which each instrument is written in a different color, and in which the four string lines frequently jump from one staff to the other in order to imitate birds flying in different formations. Stockhausen also analyzes the content of the work for Scheffer, in particular showing how the writing for the quartet is meant to merge with the sonic characteristics of the helicopters. Scheffer goes behind the scenes and, stage by stage, shows the enormous production needed to realize Helikopter-Streichquartett.""]"

The record's quite different than anything you might expect from Cosby, quite dark at times, with a really freaked-out, messed-up quality that might almost be described as psychedelic funk. Instrumentation is heavily electric, inspired by Miles Davis according to the notes, with some amazingly heavy keyboards from Bill Cosby himself. The groove stretches out massively on the album's two long tracks, filled with loads of funky riffs, heavy drums, and some wicked edits in the studio. Other musicians aren't listed, but we're betting they include Stu Gardner and some of the LA players who worked on other Cosby vocal albums. And although this one might work in the comedy racks, it's got greater appeal to fans of funky jazz and heavy soul. The record's awash in hip 70s instrumental styles and feels more like some mad blacksploitation soundtrack or funk jam session gone wild than Bill's regular comedy albums.

Seeing Sounds, their third album, is a blistering mash-up of booming Hip Hop beats and rollercoastering Rock riffs, rumbling Crunk rhythms and scintillating Soul music. Whereas their first album, In Search Of... was an imaginative, exploration of identities, and their second album, Fly Or Die, sought out the range of genres and sounds that have influenced the group, Seeing Sounds grinds everything together, evoking a sound that is un-tethered by preconceptions and convention. It is also an album that amplifies the style and attitudes that have made Pharrell, Chad and Shae transcendent cultural icons.', 'The title of N.E.R.D&apos;s third album, <i>Seeing Sounds</i>, was inspired by a TV show the ban watched about synaesthesia--the neurological disorder that causes people to experience sounds as colours or objects in their minds. The concept inspired the trio (Pharrell Williams, Chad Hugo, a.k.a. The Neptunes, and their rapping pal Shay Haley) to create a record as if it were a live show, as if the listener were really able to see the band playing. As ideas go, it&apos;s a dubious one, but it does give the band the opportunity to dive back into their musical ocean and splash noisily around, leaving listeners soaked and astounded. With the usual disregard for genre, <i>Seeing Sounds</i> opens with bass-heavy low-rider ""Time For Some Action"", before heading off on an intense roller-coaster ride that takes in the choppy, digi-drum & bass of ""Spaz"" and the infectious booty-bass of single ""Everyone Nose"" (a look at Hollywood&apos;s cocaine obsession) via a veritable kaleidoscope of colourful sound. ""Sooner or Later"" is all smooth Motown soul, ""Kill Joy"" is riff-heavy rock and ""Anti Matter"" has an Atari crunk feel. This breathless diversity is, of course, what N.E.R.D. are best at, and the good news is that <i>Seeing Sounds</i> can be considered a return to form after the nadir of <i>Fly Or Die</i>; though Whether it stands up to their debut or whether their new experiments ever get beyond the superficial, is another matter entirely. -- <i>Paul Sullivan</i>']"

Produced by Marius de Vries (Bjork, Madonna, Rufus Wainwright) Piece is a sonically brilliant recording of upbeat songs filled with Teddy\'s impassioned vocals and clever but heartfelt lyrics. Per Teddy Thompson ""I think this album is my pop record but I\'m not really sure because I\'m not sure what that word means anymore.""', ""&#34;This is a happy record,&#34; Teddy Thompson says of his new Verve Forecast release A Piece of What You Need. &#34;Well, maybe not happy, but upbeat. Actually, maybe not upbeat, but it does have some up-tempo songs! Anyway, it's as close as I've gotten to making the record I've always wanted to make.&#34; <P>Indeed, happy or not, A Piece of What You Need - Thompson's fourth album overall and his third for Verve - is the London-born, New York-based artist's most ambitious and accomplished effort to date, showcasing his formidable vocal, songwriting and guitar talents while venturing into rewarding new musical and lyrical territory. <P>Thompson's trademark blend of catchy songcraft, pensive emotional insight and good-natured black humor is present on such new tunes as &#34;In My Arms,&#34; &#34;What's This?!!,&#34; &#34;Don't Know What I Was Thinking&#34; and the bittersweetly fatalistic &#34;Turning the Gun On Myself.&#34; The album's effortless pop sensibility is matched by a playful sonic palette that incorporates such aural surprises as the careening brass band on &#34;Can't Sing Straight&#34; and &#34;One of These Days,&#34; or the Hitchcockian orchestral rushes that haunt the cinematic &#34;Jonathan's Book.&#34; <P>Although Thompson co-produced his last two albums Separate Ways and Up Close & Down Low, for A Piece of What You Need he made it a point to recruit an outside producer to help realize his expansive musical agenda. The man for the job was Marius de Vries, whose extensive production resume includes work with acts as diverse as Bjork, Madonna, David Gray and Rufus Wainwright. <P>&#34;I knew that I wanted this one to be more adventurous, with strong, solid rhythm tracks and beautiful airy touches to support the songs,&#34; Thompson explains, adding, &#34;Marius gets all the credit for that. He's taken the arrangements up a notch. There was nothing off-limits, nothing that was too weird or too difficult. I could tell him that I wanted something to sound like fairies dancing around a maypole, and he'd know what button to push to get that. We were able to add a lot more layers, without overshadowing the songs themselves.&#34; <P>Thompson, son of folk-rock legends Richard and Linda Thompson, developed his musical drive early in life and launched his first band while still in his early teens. By the time he released his self-titled solo debut in 2000, he'd served a stint in his father's touring band and contributed guitar and vocals to his dad's albums You? Me? Us? and Mock Tudor. He subsequently co-produced and played on his mother's 2002 comeback disc Fashionably Late, and toured as a member of Rosanne Cash's backing band. <P>After signing with Verve, he released his widely acclaimed 2006 sophomore album Separate Ways, which demonstrated how much his songwriting, performing and record-making skills had evolved since his debut. It was followed in 2007 by Up Front & Down Low, a collection of personally charged readings of classic American country songs that demonstrated Thompson's increased assurance as a performer and interpreter. <P>&#34;My first record was made in two weeks, and I had no idea what I was doing,&#34; Thompson states. &#34;Separate Ways was done over a long period of time in bits and pieces. And Upfront & Down Low was done quickly and was intentionally free-swinging and loose. With the new one, we put a lot of time and effort into it, but we made it pretty quickly, because we had a plan and did a lot of preparation and pre-production. Because of that, it feels more like a complete package to me. <P>&#34;But it was stressful in other ways,&#34; he adds, 'because I went into making this record without having finished a lot of the songs, which is something I've never done before. I'd be out on tour, sitting in a hotel room in Canada, pulling my hair out and trying to think of a rhyme for antediluvian. In some cases the songs ended up taking a different shape because of that, and they developed in interesting ways that they wouldn't have otherwise.&#34; <P>A Piece of What You Need is a landmark for an artist whose creative restlessness continues to yield deeply compelling musical results. Thompson's sense of purpose - and sense of humor - are reflected in the song title that provides the album's name. <P>&#34;The song was born from frustration with the state of music,&#34; he explains. &#34;I liked it as an album title because I thought it sounded like an offering, like this record is a small bit of truth. For most people, it's gonna be an absolutely miniscule piece of what they need. But I'd like to think that I'm contributing some tiny little building block of something worthwhile, rather than just adding to the massive pile of disposable rubbish.&#34;""]"

This reissue is a deliberate statement reinforced by the numbering and stringent monochrome three-color cover art. Minimalism as a form of art. A statement not unlike Yves Klein\'s blue canvasses, a viewer might take it for a mere joke or provocation, but will soon enough find himself drawn in and devoured by the maelstrom-like expanse of intense color. Stefan Betke\'s music can have a similar effect. Here, reductionism and minimalism do not equal austerity, but a sensuous, almost baroque experience, with oscillations produced by crackles and bass that envelop the body and leave it vibrating. It all started with the analog Waldorf 4 Pole filter that gave Betke his memorable moniker. Inspired by the defective equipment\'s distinctive crackles, Pole took them as a starting point for his equally simple and subtle sound layers. Here, rhythmic textures and warmly pulsing bass lines join in play, and, at least from 2, experience a slow shift towards minimal dub. Pole\'s music has a unique way of oscillating between euphony and avant-garde, between pop and experiment. While many of his electronic avant-garde peers swore off all danceable elements during the latter half of the 1990s, Pole decided to walk the edge, championing both radical reductionism and groovy, almost psychedelic dream states. Tracks like ""Kirschenessen"" or ""Hafen"" give ample proof that his music does not exhaust itself in mere functionalism, but encourages new and poetic associations. By now, all this is history. Like many genres and movements before it, techno has been declared dead more than once. Yet this does not matter to Pole one iota. He never restricted his trademark sound to techno or any other genre and his trilogy, a classic already, still resonates in contemporary electronic music. Pole\'s unmistakable crackles have infiltrated mainstream pop and even the burgeoning dubstep scene. Now, with the reissue of his first three albums, listeners get a chance to experience these three records as a coherent entity and explore this defining benchmark in the history of electronic music.']"

With a career chock full of both and a new album packed with collaborators as diverse as 50 Cent, Wyclef Jean, Richie Sambora and The Dream, and producers such as Suits, DJ Scratch, Ilfonics and Raw Uncut, EXIT 13 is the album LL Cool J fans have been clamoring for - full of passion, braggadocio and smooth rhymes. ""When it came time for me to go into the studio, I tried to make this project as relevant as my first, and having that sense of my career coming full circle. Believe me, it was a blessing to be able to go back into the studio and create this album."" Joining forces with 50 Cent on a track called ""Heartbeat,"" the two Queens natives rap over a stripped down track, while sounding like they are having a good time. ""It\'s a song about role playing,"" says LL of ""Heartbeat."" On the tracks ""Rocking With The Goat,"" LL taps into his native New Yorker persona, and teams with labelmates The Dream on EXIT 13\'s first single ""Baby."" The track, which recently debuted on the Billboard charts, marks LL\'s 42nd career chart debut. What began for LL Cool J in the nascent, burgeoning rap and hip hop scene of the 80\'s, has now seeped throughout the musical and cultural phenomenon that is today\'s hip hop. All the while, LL Cool J has remained a musical and cultural force, a living icon and a significant, relevant artist still churning out the hits. First introduced to the world in 1984 as a Def Jam Records flagship artist, LL is the first rap artist to amass ten consecutive platinum-plus selling albums, while 2004\'s ""THE DEFinition"" and 2006\'s ""Todd Smith"" both went Gold. He is currently tied for third place for most Billboard chart debuts by a rapper. As an entertainer, he has succeeded in crossing into multiple mediums. Already a talented actor, author, recording artist, two-time Grammy Award winner and NAACP Image Award winner, LL continues to display his wide range of talents in his projects. He recently inked an exclusive deal with Sears, Roebuck to brand an affordable clothing line that will appeal to families. A focal point of Sears own re-branding efforts, LL\'s merchandise is slated to hit stores in time for back to school. ""The clothes are fashion forward, and I\'m using my whole family in the ad campaign.As an actor, LL Cool J recently wrapped production on ""The Deal"" opposite William H. Macy and Meg Ryan. He also recently starred in Paramount Pictures\' ""Last Holiday,"" opposite Queen Latifah. The film was lauded by fans and critics alike and proved to be a box office draw. Both ""Last Holiday"" and ""Edison,"" a film starring Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey and Justin Timberlake, are now available on DVD. Over the years, LL has appeared in more than 30 films and starred opposite acclaimed actors such as Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrell in Sony Pictures blockbuster ""S.W.A.T.,"" Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz in Oliver Stone\'s ""Any Given Sunday,"" and Gabrielle Union in Focus Features\' ""Deliver Us from Eva."" Other film credits include ""Rollerball,"" ""Charlie\'s Angels,"" ""Kingdom Come,"" ""In Too Deep,"" ""Toys,"" and ""Slow Burn,"" with Ray Liotta. He has also received a Blockbuster Award for best comedic performance as the ""Chef"" in Renny Harlin\'s blockbuster action film ""Deep Blue Sea."" <P> Three years ago, LL transitioned to television with a dramatic and critically acclaimed performance on the second season premiere of FOX\'s hit drama ""House."" He recently guest starred on the NBC comedy ""30 Rock"" in a memorable performance as hip hop mogul Ridiculous. He currently has a new dramatic television series is in development at CBS. Also an author, LL\'s recently released his new fitness book, LL Cool J\'s Platinum Workout, which was a New York Times Bestseller. In the book LL shares his personal workout regimen in a revolutionary new program that promises to help anyone build muscle and burn fat. In 2002 he released a children\'s book, And the Winner Is, as part of Scholastics series of books and CDs by today\'s hottest rap stars called ""Hip Kid Hop.""

For the first time ever, Wolfgang Voigt aka Gas presents the visual aspect of the comprehensive Gas project in print. It is not meant to be a monolithic retrospective of his visual work, but it features a broad spectrum of photographic images taken between 1995 and 1998, showing many different moods and perspectives of Wolfgang Voigt\'s cosmos. What they all have in common is the mystical focus and seemingly, the blurring of boundaries between lightness and darkness, happiness and depression, kitsch and art, pixels and leaves. With the enclosed CD, Voigt has opened his treasure chest and presents some well-selected, rare jewels from the very early days (and nights). Four of the five tracks have never been released or played before. In the middle of the 1990s, Wolfgang Voigt, better known under a great many pseudonyms such as Mike Ink, Studio1 or Grungerman, and the driving force behind the rise of Cologne minimal techno, had reached a temporary peak in his career. Going back to the 1980s, Voigt began working under a self-realized concept he named ""Blei."" Taking in the most varied sound models, he began to extract elements from classical, polka, or brass music, and along with electronic pop music and German schlager sounds, formed a distinguished and unique pop music style that would fit in with the subculture at that time. In the early 1990s, influenced by techno, Voigt began to experiment with a timbal marching through strongly alienated, free-floating string loops. These elegiac tracks, their lack of beginning or end, their intoxicating, smooth, and partly amorphous structure sounded to him like evaporating gas and thus, Gas music was born. In his music, Wolfgang Voigt does not create a direct reference to the original sounds he alters; rather, he tries to reduce the material to its basic aesthetic structure by using different zoom, loop and alienation techniques in order to release it from its original meaning and context. His intention is to create a kind of aesthetic essence, a cave (detail/loop/repetition) where you can get thrillingly lost.']"

B001ECE5QS,A303U1MOXG5R1F,1,1229558400,Dreamsville,Carol Kidd,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Jazz']","[""Scottish jazz singer Carol Kidd makes a triumphant comeback - after an eight-year absence from the recording scene - with this gorgeous album, which introduces two of her own, original songs. With a band headed by her longtime guitarist (and co-composer) Nigel Clark and pianist Paul Harrison, she is on top form; her sublime voice as beautiful and clear as ever, her balladeering as exquisite. The two new songs fit into the mix perfectly; only an uptempo It's Alright With Me disrupts the dreamy mood. --Scotland on Sunday<br /><br />It's a brave singer who steps into Ella Fitzgerald's shoes to sing a selection of standards by Rodgers and Hart, Gershwin, Porter, Arlen and Berlin. It's a braver one still who hangs a couple of her own co-written compositions among the Picassos and Leonardos of Broadway. Those songs don't quite match the rest, but comparing Scottish jazz vocalist Carol Kidd to Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan is completely valid: her new &#34;Best of the Song Books&#34;-style album is world-class. It's not just a one-woman affair, as Kidd's voice tones in perfectly with Nigel Clark's guitar, drummer Alyn Cosker, bassist Mario Caribe and pianist Paul Harrison. This is not the conservative collection of tunes it might seem on the surface; smooth but never bland, Kidd caresses each ballad and performs every lively number like the life and soul of the party. --Sunday Herald<br /><br />Carol Kidd's first album in eight years also marks the 25th anniversary of her relationship with the Glasgow-based Linn Records. And what a partnership it has been - Kidd a faultless vocalist of impeccable stylistic credentials, and Linn a beacon of artist and audiophile quality for independent British labels. A tellingly bittersweet and plangent affair, &#34;Dreamsville&#34; is a long overdue return to the fray after the death of her partner in 2003 and subsequent trauma-induced loss of voice. Although now into her 60s, Kidd's voice remains full of character and colour, an emotionally alert and expressive instrument she puts to perfectly-phrased, beautifully-pitched use with a crafted, lightly-worn elegance that continues to astound as it delights. Two songs are new and self-penned (with guitarist Nigel Clark): There Goes My Heart is a soft, lilting leave-taking, and Do You Believe a hymning lullaby to love and second chances. A heartfelt cover of Harold Arlen's Happiness Is A Thing Called Joe is offered as a tribute to the late Humphrey Lyttelton and benefits from Paul Harrison's softly measured piano accompaniment. Indeed the four-piece band assembled here - Mario Caribe on double bass and Alyn Cosker on drums ably partnering Clark and Harrison - prove to be a crack outfit who seize a fabulous opportunity in Cole Porter's adrenalin-fuelled It's Alright With Me to show off their virtuosic wares. Illustrating a more sensitive side, Stars Fell on Alabama glints and sparkles with a hushed loveliness that makes much of Kidd's eloquent ability to hold and extend a note. Familiar standards How Deep is the Ocean?, A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square and Can't We Be Friends? are set down with consummate and engaging ease while Kidd's signature song, When I Dream, newly arranged by Nigel Clark and producer Graeme Duffin, brings things to a glowing, finely delivered conclusion. --BBC Website""]"

Between 1942 and 1951, he had 55 Top Ten hits, some of which were 'crossovers'. Louis was born in on July 8, 1908. Well versed in music from an early age, his father James was the leader of a local band. In the 1920s, father and son joined a minstrel troupe, which also included a young Homesick James. 'We'd put up a tent. It was like a carnival then,' James later said. At college in Little Rock, Louis took jobs with a number of bands. In 1932 he got together with Ida Fields, a hoofer from Texas. Then he turned up in Philadelphia, where he met trumpeter Charlie Gaines. In March 1934, the pair cut 'I Can't Dance, I Got Ants In My Pants' in New York. In the summer of 1936 Louis joined Chick Webb's band, which featured Ella Fitzgerald. He cut two sessions with Webb, where he took the chance to sing. He tried to recruit Fitzgerald to his own outfit and Webb sacked him. Louis got a residency at Harlem's Elks Rendezvous Club and a contract with Decca. There followed a decade of almost continuous hits. By the end of the 1940s, Jordan's star was waning, but his career was dealt a blow by what became Rock 'n' Roll. Worse, the leading exponent of the new music - Bill Haley - was mentored by Jordan's old manager, Milt Gabler. He was always bitter about this - but he still made some great music. He moved from label to label, seeking a return to his earlier success. Signing a contract with Mercury enabled him to revisit some of his hits, re-arranged to make them more palatable to a younger rock-oriented audience. Eleven oldies were laid down in October 1956, from which two singles were released, the second containing 'Big Bess' and 'Cat Scratchin'' - new songs that might have done better. Despite Mercury's obvious enthusiasm, little found favor with the public. But fifty years on, we can see that the quality of these last efforts is greater than their original fate implied.""]"

It's title refers to a particular drumming pattern, and points to the samba and it's playfulness. The repertoire, ranging from the late thirties to the early sixties, features a post bossa nova style that mixes acoustic and electronic in an elegant way.

Produced by Chad Stuart, the album is the 25th release of the duo, as they revisit eighteen of the most popular recordings from over a dozen worldwide LP releases in their impressive catalog. These brand new recordings, including Summer Song, Yesterday's Gone, and Homeward Bound, are a sonic marvel compared to the decades old material. They reveal the crystal clear vocals and harmonies like never before. With a mixture of original arrangements and new adaptations, Chad & Jeremy show what it s like to be masters of their craft, recording this new album themselves, and playing all the instruments. All of their Columbia albums, and several others, are represented in this brilliant new digital recording. After more than 30 years of performing together, Chad & Jeremy deliver their best ever. From 1964 to 1967, Chad & Jeremy had eleven U.S. hit singles and over seventeen worldwide releases. In the ensuing years, the music of Chad & Jeremy has been re-released on over thirty three albums around the world. The Chad & Jeremy bio at the All Music Guide states: Of the many British Invasion acts that stormed the charts in the wake of the Beatles, Chad & Jeremy possessed a subtlety and sophistication unmatched among their contemporaries, essentially creating the template for the kind of lush, sensitive folk-pop embraced by followers from Nick Drake to Belle & Sebastian . Chad Stuart and Jeremy Clyde met at drama school in 1960 and soon began playing folk clubs in London where they were discovered by famed movie composer, John Barry. They became a sensation in America riding the wave of the British Invasion with eleven Top 40 hits including Summer Song, Yesterday s Gone, Willow Weep for Me, and Distant Shores. The duo appeared as themselves in legendary TV shows including The Dick Van Dyke Show, Patti Duke Show, Batman and Laredo. They hosted Hullabaloo, appeared on The Tonight Show and all the classic variety shows like The Hollywood Palace, Andy Williams, Danny Kaye and Red Skelton. Some of their most critically acclaimed work was the progressive 1967 release Cabbages and Kings, followed a year later by The Ark, which prompted Rolling Stone Magazine to proclaim: Chad and Jeremy - out of schlock rock into progressive rock. The Ark proved to be their last album for Columbia, as Jeremy returned to acting and the duo disbanded. They reunited for an album and tour in the 1980 s as well as a musical, Pump Boys & Dinettes. The latest phase in their career began in 2003 with a PBS TV music special. Since then they have performed their two-man show all over the United States, Canada, Hawaii and the Philippines.""]"

The Vivaldi Edition: a recording venture conceived by the Italian musicologist Alberto Basso and the independent label Nave, is one of the most ambitious recording projects of the twenty-first century. Its principal objective is to record the massive collection of Vivaldi autograph manuscripts preserved today in the Biblioteca Nazionale Universitaria in Turin, some 450 works in all. This treasure trove is none other than the private library of scores Vivaldi had at home at the time of his death in Vienna in 1741 and includes his extant operas, hundreds of concertos, sacred compositions and cantatas. After a chaotic itinerary which took them from Venice to Genoa, then to Casale Monferrato in Piedmont, these manuscripts ended up almost by accident at the library in Turin, which, realising their priceless value, managed to acquire them around 1930 thanks to two generous patrons. The collection includes fifteen operas and several hundred concertos, as well as sacred compositions and secular cantatas. Most of this music has not been heard since the eighteenth century. The release of more than one hundred recordings, which began in the year 2000, will continue until 2015. The Vivaldi Edition's goal is to make this extraordinary wealth of music available to the public and at the same time to reveal the full genius of Vivaldi, not only as a composer of instrumental music, for which he was already known, but as the creator of some of the eighteenth century's most important vocal music. Beyond the realm of recording, the Vivaldi Edition is active in promoting affiliated concerts in major festivals and concert series throughout Europe and in developing multimedia projects which bring together musicians, film-makers, authors, visual artists and others.""]"

His captivating, complex genius made room for<br>all conceivable idioms and a wealth of styles ranging from the<br>grandiosely Late Romantic to the purest Absurdism. This box<br>is the first collected recording of Langgaard's 16 symphonies<br>based on the critical edition of the scores; recordings which<br>demonstrate, with spectacular sound quality, Langgaard's<br>masterly grasp of the orchestra and his ecstatic view of art."", '10/10 - Artistic & Sound Quality - Langgaard was out of his mind. Was he a crazy genius, or just plain crazy? It\'s hard to say. His 16 symphonies range in length from one hour (No. 1) to slightly more than six minutes (No. 11). There\'s a concertante work for solo piano, chorus, and orchestra (No. 3), music of Straussian refulgence (No. 6 &#34;The Heaven-Rending&#34;), some quirky faux Mendelssohn (Nos. 8 and 9), and lots of nature poetry (Nos. 2, 4, 5, 15, and 16). Most of the works have fanciful titles, ranging from No. 10 &#34;Yon Hall of Thunder&#34; to the religious mysticism of &#34;Belief in Wonders&#34; (No. 13), to No. 14\'s individual movements, such as &#34;Dads rush to the office&#34; and &#34;Radio-Caruso and forced energy&#34;. <P>God only knows what all of it means, but one thing is certain: it\'s all tremendously entertaining and never dull. The individual discs in this set have all been issued previously, most of them welcomed here enthusiastically. Thomas Dausgaard and his team deliver uniformly excellent performances captured in first-rate SACD stereo sonics. The packaging in this boxed set is really classy, with slip-cases that unfold when the top is opened, and a neatly printed booklet with informative notes and translations of the sung texts that stores in its own compartment. It\'s great to see a national label working so hard and so successfully to preserve its cultural heritage and disseminate it abroad. This project both deserves and will reward your support. -- <i>ClassicsToday.com, David Hurwitz, February 19, 2009</i><br /><br />At one time, many music lovers and record collectors, including myself, believed that the record companies were archivists who (I say who because we thought of them as people), from the beginning of the 20th century had recorded and preserved the art of both performer and composer for the present and for posterity. There were performers whose name on the label, regardless of repertoire, translated to money in the bank, particularly for EMI, RCA and Columbia who had just about everyone and everybody of significance under contract. <P> As CD sales diminish, the majors\' output is almost exclusively artist driven. Today, it is the smaller, lesser known companies that explore new repertoire played by musicians who know and illuminate the scores. Except for Naxos, Chandos, and some others who conscientiously record new repertoire, companies, by and large, are merely replacing familiar repertoire with new performances. To record and issue works by obscure composers amounts to artistic heroism, no matter how they are funded. Such an undertaking is this omnibus collection of orchestral works by Rued Langgaard assembled from performances recorded from 1998 to 2008. <P> The ninth edition of The International Cyclopedia of Music and Musicians (1964, completely revised) has no entry for Rued Langgaard, the Danish composer who lived from 1893 to 1952. It does mention his father, Siegfried, a pianist and composer who had studied with Franz Liszt. Siegfried, it seems, was also immersed in Theosophy, a religious philosophy based on meditation and mysticism, which in turn was deeply embraced by Rued. His music attempts and, depending on the listener\'s frame of mind, succeeds in conveying his belief in dimensional realities beyond empirical perceptions. <P> Langgaard was an ingenuously inventive and highly skilled composer and orchestrator. He was not a Stravinsky, a Schoenberg or a Shostakovich but his lack of originally is compensated by an ingenious and inspired invention within the established Late Romantic style. <P> His first symphony, written in 1911, was premiered by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Max Fiedler. This hour-long work is already indicative of his later symphonic development and his individual rhapsodic, drama driven output, sounding for all the world like epic film scores which clearly puts him ahead of his time. This is certainly not a deprecating characterisation but these are the impressions of today, not then. A group of five named orchestral pieces of special character, deeply moving in the Liszt-Wagner genre, round out the collection. <P> Will Rued Langgaard\'s career now take off? Will his symphonies become standard repertoire? Will musical dictionaries now enlarge their coverage? Will we hear his tunes whistled in the subway? Not a chance. But by the same token I commend the colossal and patient undertaking by DACAPO to bring Langgaard\'s music to our attention in such superlative performances as these and their many other CDs and DVDs of the music of this undeservedly obscure composer. <P> This set is a generous appetiser. In addition to his symphonic scores, Langgaard wrote operas, music for the stage, chamber music including string quartets, etc. <P> I intend to explore his music further. -- <i>Wholenote Magazine, Bruce Surtees, June 2009</i><br /><br />Rating: 5 stars <br></br> Over fifty years after the death of Rued Langgaard (1893-1952), and after so many years of neglect and omission, Langgard\'s contribution to Denmark\'s music is recognised in this superb set of SACDs from DaCapo, the first with a Danish orchestra. In addition, earlier this year, the new concert hall for Danish Radio was opened, and the new road leading to it named `Rued Langgaards Vej\'. Recorded over a period of ten years, the project has had time to produce lasting results, and recording quality from beginning to end is uniformly excellent.<br></br> <P>Thomas Dausgaard writes: ""There are three things that have been very important to me in this project: one has been to record the music of this unique talent with the very orchestra that rejected him throughout his life. The second has been that the music has at the same time been published in new critical editions. The Langgaard expert Bendt Viinholt Nielsen and the publisher Edition Samfundet have done fantastic pioneering work with the new editions, and for that reason the recordings are more than just recordings - we have been on a mission to make his music available on more than one level. The third important thing for me has been to present the symphonies in a chronological context. For in Langgaard\'s symphonies there are constant references to time. To his own time, to the past and to the time between the works. From wild modernism to retrospective time. It is as if Langgaard brings up the issue of whether the time when a work is written means anything at all. This is a point that emerges when the symphonies are heard in chronological order.""<br></br> Langgaard\'s cycle of symphonies presents the listener with a wide variety of styles - from the large, remarkably mature and astonishing First Symphony written when he was yet a teenager, to the terse modernist short works and the backward-looking romantic ones from his middle age. Born in 1893 to musical parents, he learned much from his father, a composer and pianist and pupil of Liszt, and his mother who was also a pianist. His aunt on his father\'s side was married to Niels Gade\'s son. Rued was educated at home and then at the Horneman Conservatoire where he also studied the organ and violin as well as composition, Carl Nielsen being one of his teachers. He was also a talented artist. His first public recital took place in 1905 when he performed improvisations on the organ in the Marmor Church in Copenhagen.<br></br> <P>Langgaard\'s symphonies come from four phases of his life. The first ""spiritual"" phase includes the first three symphonies, the second, the more modernist works, including the ""Music of the Spheres"" and the next three symphonies. The third phase marks the beginning of Langgaard\'s looking back to the romantic era of the mid to late 19th century and includes the 7th to 10th symphonies, and the substantial organ work Messis shortly due for DaCapo on SACD. The last phase contains the final, terse symphonies, to a certain extent products of the composer\'s frustration with his lot. All need no introduction and survive as absolute music on their own terms; listening to them in chronological order without their attached histories has been a singularly rewarding experience. <br></br> Langgaard was fortunate on the one hand to have been given an annual stipend after early successes, but struggled until 1940 to find a full-time post of organist despite very many applications, due to his perceived difficult temperament, and some unwise public criticism of Carl Nielsen whose supporters were merciless in their attacks on Langgaard. The two composers had a little in common but ought not to have been considered as musical rivals. Early successes, in Berlin with his First Symphony, in Darmstadt where he conducted the Fourth, and in Vienna in 1922 where his Second was performed, did not lead to fame in his native Copenhagen. At around this time, his mother made the first of her attacks on the ethos of Copenhagen\'s musical life, and coupled with those on Nielsen\'s work led Langgaard on precisely the wrong path. As Jesper Buhl wrote ""He had - like the hero of an inverse Hans Christian Andersen fairy-tale - turned from a white duckling into an ugly swan.""<br></br> <P>After his mother died in 1926, he married Valborg Constance Tetens, who had been living with the Langgaards, and she remained a tremendous support to him and his music until her own death in 1969.<br></br> <P>Rued Langgaard\'s music will continue to divide opinion, but after years of being thought of as, in Bendt Nielsen\'s words, Denmark\'s ""problem child"" composer, his works have been reassessed over the last twenty years and valued more highly. Langgaard said of himself: ""To be the very essence of paradox, that is my calling.""<br></br> <P>Recording quality is generally superb especially in high resolution surround mode, with the orchestra set in a generous acoustic and voices caught successfully. Performances have been quite palpably lovingly prepared, and DaCapo and Thomas Dausgaard deserve much gratitude for providing this crucially important piece of Danish musical history in top-class readings and sound.<br></br> <P>Included below are the numbers of the separate discs, the earlier ones not SACD, and the recording dates, not in the booklet in the boxed set. Bendt Viinholdt Nielsen, who compiled the first printed catalogue of Langgaard\'s 432 compositions, provided many of the details about Langgaard here, obtainable at Langgaard.dk.<br></br> CD 1 (also on SACD 6.220525) <br></br> Symphony No. 1 ""Klippepastoraler"" (""Mountain Pastorals"") BVN 32 (1908-11) <br></br> 1.

He began writing the First Symphony in the same year, aged just 12, completing it three years later. The first performance was given in 1913 with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Max Fiedler. The same concert included Sphinx written a little later and included on the last disc in this set.<br></br> <P>Lasting an hour and in five substantial movements and written for a large orchestra, this work shows Langgaard had remarkable facility with orchestration, and, as with Franck, there are signs that an organist is at work. Perhaps inspired by Tchaikovsky, Wagner and Bruckner, the work is nonetheless original and features a richly scored journey from the foot of the mountain where the surf breaks against the rocks to the magisterial and wide vista at its summit. In this performance the horns and low brass are particularly impressive in what was considered at the time an unplayable work; there are eight horns, two tenor and two bass tubas to make a wonderfully powerful effect. <br></br> <br></br> CD 2 (also on SACD 6.220516) <br></br> Symphony No. 2, &#34;Awakening of Spring,&#34; BVN 53 Original version (1912-14)* <br></br> 1.

This is a work full of the freshness of youth and joie de vivre, setting in the last movement two poems by Rittershaus, ""Sounds of Spring"" and In Spring"". Architecturally the work is a little disparate; the first movement could exist on its own, the second is a beautifully written slow movement.<br></br> <P>By this stage, Siegfried Langgaard had died, and the introverted Rued came under the sole influence of his somewhat over-protective mother. The Third Symphony is a piano concerto in all but name, a fantasia for piano and orchestra with a chorus in the final movement, here splendidly performed by Per Salo who is perfectly balanced with the orchestra. The work is subtitled ""Eternal Light, Holy Flame, always changing, forever the same. Always dying, forever running..."" and this goes some way to describe the music. <br></br> <P><br></br> CD 3 (also on CD 8.224215)<br></br> <P>Symphony No. 4 ""Lvfald"", BVN 124 (1916, rev. 1920) <br></br> 1.

The Fourth Symphony (Leaf Fall) is performed more often than most, and takes its inspiration from Autumn, all its moods and the related moods in people. This makes quite a change from Langgaard\'s focus on Spring, for here we encounter death, decay and the taking of leave. This is a powerful and compact work, its popularity unsurprising. In one movement in many sections (Langgaard is said to have completed it in less than a week), the programme is unimportant. <br></br> Symphony No. 5 is much more extrovert and its programme concerns the fantasy world of the Nordic summer landscape populated by heroes and legends. The two different forms which the composer himself called Versions I and II contain less than half the music in common, the first ending effectively with a reduction to nothingness. <br></br><br></br> CD 4 (also on CD 8.224180) <br></br> Symphony No. 6 ""Det Himmelrivende"", BVN 165 (1919-20, rev. 1928-30) <br></br> 1.

Strong stuff! The music pictures the battles between Good and Evil in all its forms, though whatever pictures are conjured up will be up to the listener as the music is not written with a tight programme in mind. <br></br> There is, as is common with Langgaard\'s music, more than one version of the Seventh Symphony, this dating from 1926; another dates from 1932 and that one\'s first movement is sufficiently different for us to hope for a recording from these forces. This work marks a change in emphasis in his style, being the first in classical four movement form. It has the title ""By Tordenskjold in Holmen\'s Church"" though this is useful only as an idea for its inspiration. The second movement has a quite delightful middle section, but the last seems to end prematurely in an off-hand way. <br></br> The change in style coincides with the change in Langgaard\'s circumstances; shortly afterwards his mother died, he became married, and the long trying for a permanent post had already been in full swing. <br></br> The Eighth is titled ""Memories at Amalienborg"" and again is in four movements, though this time without titles. The first two movements are the most successfully written with a fine classical scherzo. Perhaps the music of the last movement is just too trite and without much substance to be entirely successful. <br></br><br></br> CD 5 (also on CD 8.224182) <P>Symphony No. 9, ""From Queen Dagmar\'s City"", BVN 282 (1942) <br></br> 1.

Written around the time Langgaard started his only permanent full-time post, as organist in Ribe, this is approachable fare with hints of Richard Strauss in the bolder passages. This symphony marks a return to this form for the first time in well over a decade. In the intervening period Langgaard revised earlier symphonies and devoted himself to writing church and organ music and songs. The symphony\'s optimism may well be due to his gaining the new post in Ribe Cathedral.<br></br> <P>The Tenth Symphony was completed just before the end of the Second World War, and is the last of the romantically inspired works, this time inspiration coming from seascapes. Vividly recorded and performed this work is both meaty and easily digestible. <br></br> The tiny Eleventh Symphony lasts under six minutes but makes its mark with its large orchestra and searing mood; this tiny work packs a massive punch. Named ""Ixion"" by Constance, a reference to the King of that name being bound on an eternally revolving wheel as a punishment from Zeus for his love for Hera. <br></br> <br></br> CD 6 (SACD 6.220517)<br></br> <P>The three symphonies on this CD were written during the years 1946-1948, although the tonal language is provocatively conservative. Symphony No. 12 is an absurd construction full of autobiographical references.

This is the product of an angry frustrated man, the movement\'s section\'s autobiographic titles telling all. Not that the music is all angry by any means, but it is very much a concentrate, reminiscences of the composer of his First Symphony as a sort of highly distorted dream. <br></br> Symphony No. 13 again was named by Constance; this work needed much research on the score by Bendt Viinholdt Nielsen and Constance to sort out Langgaard\'s remarkably messy manuscript after much reworking. And again, this is the product of the angry ignored composer, master of protest and revolt. Originally this symphony was attached to the next, the Fourteenth, ""The Morning"", with its jokey, tongue-in-cheek titles. The words the chorus sings are more serious ""The Star of Kings and the Star of Lords/Will appear to us in his own good time"" and despite the brevity of some sections in relation to others the overall effect is not as outr as might be predicted. However, it must be said that the result is disparate, some parts having the potential to exist better on their own.

The Fifteenth hints back to the modernist phase, the ""Sea Storm"" being more a picture of Langgaard\'s mind, than one in it, as by this stage, his feeling of neglect by Denmark\'s concert promoters, and his continued abandonment fifteen years after Nielsen\'s death hurt deeply. His works did get broadcast performances in the 1940s, though he never heard his last, the 16th (""Sun Deluge""). This final symphony harks back to his First, and coupled with his renewed interest in theosophy about which he wrote a great deal, and in which his father had been very interested, the end result is a fine work, a work in which Langgaard\'s ethos is summed up. <br></br> This last symphony was dedicated to the Danish National Radio Symphony Orchestra but not performed until 1966. The Fourth Symphony had had a nationwide broadcast in 1950. <br></br> The collection ends with a compendium of shorter works, some very early, like ""Sfinx"" (Sphinx), a very proficient piece by any measure, let alone that of a sixteen year old, and others written much later in his neglected and acerbic phase.<br></br> <P>Langgaard suffered a stroke in 1951, and struggled to continue with his work in cathedral in Ribe despite the difficulties with one hand. However, he recovered sufficiently to manage to perform the first part of ""Messis"" on Good Friday, in April 1952. After giving up his post in June 1952, he died a month later in July, aged just 59 years. -- <i>Audiophile Audition, Peter Joelson, March 30, 2009</i>']"

I would just see those people my music heroes hanging out at the bar like everyone else she remembers. I could see myself in them. It gave me inspiration to do my own thing.<br><br>After doing the usual business of playing local shows, the trio set out the following year on a regional tour. One of the first gigs of the trip took them to a bar in Akron, where Black Keys' drummer Patrick Carney just happened to be one of only a handful of people in the audience. This chance encounter led Wennerstrom and the Heartless Bastards to Fat Possum Records, with whom they released their debut, Stairs and Elevators, in early 2005.<br><br>The band moved on with critical praise in their back pocket, including a four-and-a-half star review from Rolling Stone, which took note that, when Wennerstrom opens her throat on Stairs and Elevators ... she sounds like she s wailing on the shoulders of giants; her sad and angry vocals channeling all the swagger and spit of a young Robert Plant <br><br>All This Time, was released during the summer of 2006, it received even more widespread critical acclaim than Stairs and Elevators. The Bastards played hundreds of shows to support the record. They played huge festivals and toured with Wilco & Lucinda Williams. Wennerstrom s songs appeared often on TV shows & in films, this would be measured by most as a huge success. Though in Wennerstrom s mind her sound and band were still evolving, and she knew it was time for a change. <br><br>In true ascetic discipline, she moved to Austin, Texas in 2007 for a change of inspirational scenery and a new recording project. With the help of producer Mike McCarthy (Spoon, Trail of Dead), she assembled a group of musicians with whom she gave the songs life and uncovered yet another layer of herself and the Heartless Bastards. The two new Bastards aren t Texas ringers, but fellow Dayton brethren Dave Colvin on drums, and Jesse Ebaugh on bass, who actually played on the original demo that hooked Fat Possum. <br><br>The album, entitled The Mountain, delivers the powerful howl that fans expect from the Heartless Bastards, but also weaves in adventure with mandolins, banjos, strings and Erika s transcendent voice.""]"

Never mind. There is no finer performance available, and certainly none better recorded: gorgeous, perfectly natural sound whether in regular stereo or SACD surround-sound. So what makes this performance so special? First, and speaking generally, this has got to be one of the most shapely, elegant, and effortlessly flowing versions ever committed to disc. Every phrase breathes, but in such a way that the character of the line always supports what the music seems to want to do. The &#34;interpretation&#34; simply dissolves into the pure experience of Schubert. <br></br> Getting down to specifics, listen to the marvelously conversational exchanges between violinist Christian Tetzlaff and pianist Martin Helmchen in the opening movement, and the amazingly perfect intonation of all of the string players. Then there's the perfect balance of Alois Posch's double bass, and the wonderful, dreamy quality of the initial presentation of the &#34;Trout&#34; theme in the fourth movement. The players' wide dynamic range lets them wring every drop of energy from the finale without ever forcing the tone, and it's impossible to overpraise Helmchen's sensitivity in both his solo and accompanying roles. <br></br> The couplings prove equally inspired, offering the sort of variety that makes this disc ideal for continuous listening. Usually we encounter the &#34;Trockne Blumen&#34; Variations on flute discs, where they either obliterate the inferior junk that accompanies them, or make you want to scream from the aural fatigue of hearing so much other flute music (let's face it: a little goes a long way). Here they make a refreshing contrast, with Aldo Baerten's soft-toned wooden flute marrying beautifully to Helmchen's elegant keyboard artistry. Yes, Baerten breathes a bit heavily from time to time, but it's not really bothersome. With the lovely Notturno an apt and mellow encore, this is surely one of the great Schubert chamber music recordings. You'll love it.

Scored for a sizeable<br>orchestra of triple woodwind,<br>four horns, three each of<br>trumpets and trombones, tuba,<br>timpani, percussion, celesta,<br>harps and strings, the Symphony<br>makes extensive use of<br>revolutionary songs as thematic<br>elements, as it progresses,<br>without pause, from the glacial<br>opening movement, Palace<br>Square, to the terrifying<br>massacre and its aftermath, The<br>Ninth of January, the funereal<br>third movement, Eternal<br>Memory, and the final movement,<br>The Tocsin, which culminates<br>with cataclysmic bell strokes."", ""Written to commemorate the abortive 1905 revolution Shostakovich's 11th Symphony, like the 12th which commemorates the 1917 revolution, lacks the weight or distinction of musical thought and logic which so characterizes the 10th and 13th Symphonies. What we forget, I think, is that the composer is writing in a popular idiom so as to reach as many people as he can. There is nothing wrong in being popular - for too long this has been seen as weak work and not a desire to communicate. As he was writing with regard to important events in Russian history I can well imagine that Shostakovich wanted to reach as many members of the public as he could with his music. <br></br> But make no mistake - the 11th Symphony is in no way an easy listen; you can't sit back and bask in the colourful orchestration and good tunes. Playing for nearly an hour, in four big movements, which run together and share material, some of them revolutionary songs, there is something cinematic about the way the piece is constructed - but this is because of the way Shostakovich cuts between ideas and creates quite vivid visual images; indeed there is one section in the second movement (at 10:58) which always reminds me, for reasons I cannot explain, of the Odessa Steps sequence from Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin - perhaps Naxos could be persuaded to record Edmund Meisel's fine score for this film, for it warrants further hearings. <br></br> The first movement - Palace Square - is the calm before the storm. All is quiet, the music is restrained and delicate, soft string chords, quite beautiful in themselves, are interrupted by menacing fanfares from muted trumpets. There's a disturbed climax but the peace continues as if the insistent brass calls didn't exist. Fury is unleashed in The Ninth of January, the date (old style, Julian calendar) is significant for on that Sunday, subsequently known as Bloody Sunday, the Orthodox Priest George Gapon led a workers' procession to the Winter Palace (the square of the first movement) to deliver a petition to Tsar Nicholas II. However, the troops guarding the Winter Palace opened fire on the crowd, causing over 100 deaths. This is considered to be the start of the revolution. Shostakovich depicts the slaughter with music of vehemence, interspersed with reminiscences of the music of the first movement but transformed into icy sounds, long gone are the reassuring string sonorities. Hence my feelings about the Odessa Steps sequence. This is thrilling music and its forward momentum is irresistible. The third movement - Eternal Memory - is an elegy for the dead, deeply felt and with a passionate and yearning climax. The final movement, for it doesn't feel like a finale in the conventional sense - The Tocsin (which is a signal or alarm sounded on a bell) - is a wild march, grotesque and misformed, the workers rising, I presume. A slower section towards the end sings of grief before the final onslaught of bells and workers songs. It's a very fine piece. <br></br> And this is a very fine performance. With the Liverpool Phil on top form, responding to every one of Petrenko's demands, it is a resounding success. It is electrifying in the way that a concert performance is - indeed, it's hard to believe that this was recorded over two days, so immediate is the impact of the playing. The recording has an astonishingly huge wide dynamic range, the opening chords are so quiet that are, when played at a normal volume setting, almost inaudible. Turn the colume control up and the recording is as clear and bright as one could wish for. Every department of the orchestra is exceptionally well balanced, not an easy job in some of the fuller parts - and there are some very full tuttis - and, best of all, at the very end where the bells describe major and minor thirds in G the clangour is left to reverberate after the music has ended - absolutely thrilling. Whatever you do don't be without Stokowski's quite magnificent 1958 recording with the Houston Symphony Orchestra (EMI 6520622) and don't be without this new release - I couldn't be without either! This is an essential disk for all collections. -- <i> MusicWeb International, Bob Briggs, May 2009</i><br /><br />Billed as the start of a new complete Shostakovich symphony cycle, this initial entry holds a great deal of promise. The Eleventh Symphony has more the character of a film score than a traditional symphonic work: it thrives on atmosphere, color, and the repetition of simple tunes and motives rather than drama created by development and tonal contrast. Conductor Vasily Petrenko certainly understands this, whether in capturing the ghostly string timbres of the opening (reinforced by celesta on its many subsequent returns), in the crushing massacre sequence in the second movement, or in the splashy ending, with cymbals, bells, and tam-tam making cinematic contributions.<br></br> Petrenko's also very sensible in his handling of tempo. The first and third movements don't drag; the second and fourth have plenty of excitement with rhythms that never turn mechanical (as they have a tendency to do, what with so much militaristic march music). The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic plays very well, with distinguished contributions from all departments. My only quibble concerns the slightly backward positioning and lack of clarity afforded the timpanist, who carries much of the thematic substance of the first movement and presides over the massacre's percussion fusillades. Otherwise, this is pretty terrific on all counts. I recommend it accordingly, and look forward to the continuation of the cycle -- <i>ClassicsToday.com, David Hurwitz, April 2009</i><br /><br />The good news is this recording of Shostakovich's Eleventh Symphony is in the same class as the best ever made. The even better news is it's the start of a projected series of recordings of all the Soviet master's symphonies. Vasily Petrenko has demonstrated before this disc that he is among the most talented of young Russian conductors with superb recordings of Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony and of selected ballet suites. But neither of those recordings can compare with this Eleventh. Paired as before with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, Petrenko turns in a full-scale riot of a performance that is yet tightly controlled and cogently argued. Said to depict the failed revolution of 1905, Shostakovich's Eleventh is not often treated with the respect it deserves, except, of course, by Yevgeny Mravinsky, the greatest of Shostakovich conductors whose two accounts have been deemed the most searing on record. Until now: Petrenko respects the composer's score and his intentions by unleashing a performance of staggering immediacy and violence, a virtuoso performance of immense drama, enormous tragedy, and overwhelming power. Recorded in extraordinarily vivid digital sound, this disc deserves to be heard by anyone who admires Shostakovich's music. -- <i>Allmusic.com, James Leonard, April 2009</i>""]"

It is approximately 7-14days on delivery date. You wholeheartedly support customers as satisfactory. Thank you for you seeing it.', ""Roswell Rudd's idea of a trombone army is not as pronounced as one might think when initially looking at the credits. It's not an offshoot of Slide Hampton's World of Trombones, but elaborates on the concept somewhat. Certainly Rudd's veteran status allows him to invite players of different generations who admire him, as Deborah Weisz, Sam Burtis, Josh Roseman, Eddie Bert, Ray Anderson, Wycliffe Gordon, or Steve Swell all fit that bill. Rudd apportions different lineups to play music with far reaching implications, including that of ethnic and down home, creative improvised, European, and American jazz traditions. The music constantly evolves and shapes itself in chameleon proportions, ignoring nothing that Rudd has himself experienced in his lengthy and distinguished career as an original individualist. Five tracks feature the proper Trombone Tribe, with Weisz, Swell, Rudd, Bob Stewart on tuba, bassist Henry Grimes, and drummer Barry Altschul, a quite formidable ensemble. They include a tuneful and easy swinging tribute for the recently deceased British saxophonist &#34;Elton Dean,&#34; the appropriately titled &#34;No End&#34; with the bass lead of Grimes firing up trombone solos with false starts and then steamrolling solos, the samba/Latinized, warm and soulful &#34;To the Day&#34; with bass filling the cracks of a New Orleans-cum-central African theme, the bluesy soul-jazz &#34;Sand in My Slide Shuffle,&#34; and the conversational, Dxieland inspired, bawdy, free, low-down, and cleverly titled &#34;Slide & the Family Bone.&#34; Two other cuts feature Rudd and the other five trombonists, a brass phalanx of epic proportions. They do the frantic, herky-jerky, Kurt Weill circus inspired &#34;Astroslyde&#34; paralleling bass note informed East European bands, while &#34;Hulla Gulla&#34; is a blues up and down motif derived from a bottom end vamp. Trumpeter Steven Bernstein and Sexmob goof up  la Thelonious Monk in New Orleans during &#34;Twelve Bars,&#34; the famous Herbie Nichols march tune laced with the alto sax of Briggan Krauss, while Bonerama get their kicks on the funky strut &#34;Bone Again,&#34; with Matt Perrine's sousaphone doing the dirty deed. The final five-piece suite and the introductory fanfare has Rudd working with Gangbe, the world music brass group from Benin, in short, thematic bursts based in joyous shouts, the religious Doxology precept, dance to spiritual music, tuba with vocal chanting, and a modal improvisation, again via Monk. They playing from top to bottom is fantastic, diversity the watchword as you would expect, and the cohesion of all the groups quite enjoyable from track to track, and never boring. It's a genuine triumph for Roswell Rudd in the golden years of a very successful occupancy in modern music, and comes highly recommended. <br>- Michael G. Nastos --AllMusic.com""]"

No one illustrates that confluence better than the Seattle-born, Brooklyn-based guitarist Miles Okazaki, who, in a few years, has burst on the scene with a musical approach that is rooted and revolutionary in its sophistication and simplicity, both of which are on full display on his amazing Sunnyside debut, Generations. Joining Okazaki on this impressive label debut are alto saxophonists Miguel Zenn, David Binney, and Christof Knoche; vocalist Jen Shyu, drummer Dan Weiss, and bassist Jon Flaugher, a group of musicians that has been working together for over ten years. Written, produced and illustrated by Okazaki, whose simmering guitar sound is a unique blend of traditional, unprocessed tone and futuristic musical vocabulary, the nine tracks weave and breathe with a melodic, rhythmic and harmonic character much in the way an artist paints with a brushstroke.<br><br> This recording was made in a single continuous take, in order to present the material as it might be heard in a live setting. As a result, there are no breaks between tracks, Okazaki writes in the CD liner notes.<br><br>The goal of this unusual approach to recording is to capture the energy and authenticity of live performance, while maintaining the high sonic quality of the studio. The result is a syncretic and sophisticated wall of swinging sound, laced with the triple-threat saxophonics of Zenon, Binney and Knoche; Shyu s Icarusian vocals, Flaugher s anchor-sure basslines, Weiss lickety-split drumming, and Okazaki s point-of-departure textured expressions: from the complex, swing-at-speed-of sound pace of Sun, Generations and the anthemic Moon, to the funereal Latinesque tinges of Fractal, and Waves; the cosmic jam vibe of Ghosts, and Weiss volcanic drumming on Break. Okazaki constructs a sound-world that breathes instead of dictates, allowing the musicians to paint their own sonic stories on his compositional canvas.', ""Electric guitarist Miles Okazaki is the leader on this recording, but that role is primarily as a composer of this music. It was done in one take as a continuous piece like it would be performed in concert, with no breaks. Okazaki's spare sound takes charge only in select instances, leaving the bulk of the work to any of three alto saxophonists and vocalist Jen Shyu, who concentrates on cryptic wordless vocals. Through generations of progressive jazz styles and the performers present, Okazaki moves through many written phases and improvised sections of music that firmly approach film noir and contemporary styles separated by natural or ethnic elements densely packed into one lengthy package. Even challenged listeners will be hard pressed to listen all the way through, because the music goes through so many emotional changes and phases in Zen fashion. Still, there's worthy and brilliant music devised, as more outstanding individual tracks can be enjoyed on their own merits. The three saxophonists David Binney, Christof Knoche, and Miguel Zenn all play alto in a similar tone and timbre requiring their sounds command close listening, or a referral to the liner notes to find out who's who. Okazaki's music flows but not in a straight line, more crooked and unpredictable, with craggy ridges and waterfalls that tumble sideways. &#34;Overture&#34; sets this crazy pace in continually mixed meters as Shyu and drummer Dan Weiss adapt this music via East Indian ragas and sped up pacings. &#34;Sun&#34; is saxed up, brittle and fractured, conjuring high drama. A slight tango on the lengthy &#34;Waves&#34; features all three horns soloing, a rhythmically staggered idea on the title cut has Zenn up front during a mutated 6/8 beat, and Binney's best work comes at the end for &#34;Moon,&#34; a power train song identified by the unique saxophonist's furious flailing. Knoche is the lesser known commodity, coalescing with bassist Jon Flaugher on the darker, creepy &#34;Ghosts,&#34; and you hear Okazaki's voice clearly on the after-hours midnight blue hued &#34;Magic,&#34; which is more hymnal and ethnic than amazing. The three horns finally play together during &#34;Fractal&#34; as Shyu's singing lights the fuse. There are times, as on this track, where her voice is buried in an uneven mix, but it is generally not an issue. This is demanding music, no matter your preferences, and it is best heard in concert. Nonetheless, fine music is made, even if it is not for impatient listeners with short attention spans. <br>- Michael G. Nastos --AllMusic.com""]"

This new edition includes a bonus track in the instrumental <i>What Shall I Do</i> as well as the title track hit and the northern soul classic <i>(A Case Of) Too Much Love Makin'</i>. The 16 page full color booklet includes an extensive essay and interview with Gloria. Remastered in 24 bit from the original analog masters."", ""In the annals of popular music, the legacy of Barry White is secure. His blend of pop, soul, and disco was a style unto itself. His distinct voice purred low and seductively underneath his Love Unlimited Orchestra. There is no doubting his influence on the two generations of crooners who followed, though no one has quite captured the sophistication of his seminal work from the 1970s. However, there is one individual who is often overlooked in White's oeuvre. Her name is Gloria Scott.<P>Right about the time Barry White had begun his ascent on the pop and R&B charts, an album entitled <b>What Am I Gonna Do</b> (1974) hit record store shelves. It was slated to launch the solo career of the Bay Area-based Scott, following her work with the likes of Sly Stone, Johnny Otis, and Ike & Tina Turner. Scott was signed to White's Soul Unlimited production company whereupon White produced all eight tracks on <b>What Am I Gonna Do</b>. Back to front, it was a first-class production on par with anything White released at the time or would later record. It also marked the second release for Neil Bogart's newly launched label, Casablanca Records.<P>However, a combination of factors, including the growing pains of a new record company and White's focus on his own burgeoning career, ultimately limited the reach of <b>What Am I Gonna Do</b>. Though a follow-up single, <i>Just As Long as We're Together</i>, hit the R&B Top 20 and held the top spot on the Disco Singles chart in early-1975, the second album she recorded with arranger H.B. Barnum was not released. For all his solo success, Barry White was not delivering on his contract with Gloria Scott. He became one of the most seminal figures of the 1970s while Scott faded into obscurity.<P>Until recently. Soul music enthusiasts have long revered <b>What Am I Gonna Do</b> and kept Gloria Scott's name alive more thirty years after her debut, which is her only full-length album released to date. Since 1974, it's had a few resurrections around the world, including a 1996 CD issue in Japan and a European release in 2003. The album is currently reissued by Reel Music. More than 26,000 hits of uploaded streams from <b>What Am I Gonna Do</b> and the <i>Just As Long as We're Together</i> single on YouTube have raised Scott's profile higher now than 35 years ago. --Popmatters.com, March 2009""]"

B0027DQHOG,A518S7KT78N51,1,1351728000,Mahler: Symphony No. 6 ~ Tennstedt,Mahler,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Classical', 'Symphonies']","['London Philharmonic Orchestra - Klaus Tennstedt, direction', 'EMI issued two recordings of the Mahler Sixth performed by the London Philharmonic conducted by Klaus Tennstedt. The first was recorded in Abbey Road Studios in 1983 (three months prior to the present recording), the second at a live concert in the Royal Festival Hall in 1991. The first is still available domestically as part of a complete cycle; the second shared a three-disc box with a live Seventh from 1993 and has been deleted. This new release from the LPO\'s own label was recorded by the BBC at the Royal Festival Hall. <P>Tennstedt shared with Leonard Bernstein an overtly emotional response to Mahler\'s music; as with Bernstein, this meant that detail was sometimes obscured in deference to the long line and the emotional arc of the symphony; instrumental execution was also occasionally less than stellar. What is undeniable, though, is that Tennstedt was committed heart and soul to music, and to Mahler\'s music in particular. <P>The 1983 EMI recording is typical of Tennstedt\'s approach: the first movement march is measured but determined, while the ""Alma"" theme is impassioned and then warmly expressive. The first theme of the Scherzo is very aggressive; the Trios are naive and ungainly by way of extreme contrast. The Andante is like the sadder, wiser older brother of the Fifth\'s Adagietto, offering solace but acknowledging the pain of deep hurt that can\'t be completely forgotten, even in Mahler\'s beloved mountains. The last movement is truly epic as the heroic struggle between the major and minor modes ultimately culminates in Mahler\'s bleakest coda. Throughout, Tennstedt wrings every note from this score (the Ratz revision). <P>EMI\'s sound production--an early digital job--is often crude in its closely miked and tightly focused imaging. The sound seems to broaden out as the Symphony proceeds, and whether this was intentional or not, it can be effective: the first movement sounds almost cramped, while the finale fully exploits all of Mahler\'s unique orchestration. The sound of this new disc, then, is reason for celebration: there is better instrumental definition and a wider soundstage; the resonance of the hall is stark contrast to the sterility of the studio in the EMI recording (there is a surprising amount of hiss on the new disc, however). The orchestra is more naturally balanced and the LPO violins have more body and less stridency, as do the trumpets; the low instruments have more depth. The triangle, xylophone, celesta, and cowbells are finally reproduced with fidelity; only the hammer blows of the last movement fail to make the desired effect. <P>The performance, as an interpretation, differs little from its sibling on EMI; but the urgency of the first-movement march comes through even more forcefully, and the ""music from far away"" is even more otherworldly in its ethereal calm. The ""grotesque"" nature of the Scherzo is even more pronounced in this performance due to the better sound, and the two appearances of the Trio are entirely free from schmaltz, without shedding their pathetic character. One of the strengths of Tennstedt\'s Mahler is his intuitive grasp of tempo: other conductors may have produced more accurate accounts--Boulez and Eschenbach, to name two--but Tennstedt, like Bernstein before him, found the places to inject just that extra measure of rubato to give the music breath and breadth, and this Scherzo is a prime example. <P>The Andante is further proof of the emotional intensity of the vision Tennstedt was able to communicate. The occasional lapses in ensemble do nothing to mar the sense of commitment shared by orchestra and conductor. The performance of the finale (at just shy of 31 minutes) is over two minutes shorter in duration than the version of three months earlier, and the audience can\'t even wait for the last notes to fade before launching a cascade of bravos. <P>Those listeners who felt that the 1983 EMI recording was compromised by the sound production are urged to acquire this new set, which easily supplants that earlier performance, taking its place on the shelf of truly memorable Mahler recordings. -- <i>Fanfare, Christopher Abbot, Nov/Dec 2009</i>']"

Decades after the photographer's passing, a cache of work made by this solitary and oft-reviled man was rediscovered, and he has come to be regarded as an important outsider artist. Among the many drawn to his plain yet deeply evocative pictures was Chuck Helm, Director of the Performing Arts at the Wexner Center in Columbus, Ohio, who introduced guitarist and composer Bill Frisell to Disfarmer's oeuvre on the hunch that Frisell might be inspired by it. <br>Says Helm, the catalyst for Disfarmer, 'To me, Bill Frisell is a uniquely American artist with a distinctive and singular musical voice, like that of Thelonious Monk or Aaron Copland. In his probing yet atmospheric evocations of American vistas I could hear parallels to the emotional truths of Disfarmer's compelling photographs.' <br>As Helm suspected, Disfarmer's work resonated with Frisell and led to the creation of a touring multimedia work, Disfarmer Project - featuring Frisell, lap steel guitar player Greg Leisz and violinist Jenny Scheinman, plus slides of Disfarmer's photos, displayed on screens. The piece premiered on March 3, 2007 at the Wexner Center, on the campus of Ohio State University. The score was subsequently recorded in Seattle and Nashville, produced by Frisell's longtime collaborator Lee Townsend and also featuring Viktor Krauss on bass. Along with the Frisell's original compositions, he interpolates versions of such tunes as Arthur Crudup's 'That's Alright Mama' and Hank Williams Sr.'s 'I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)' into this subtly yet stunningly beautiful set.""]"

Three to four years ago, the main writers for Kansas - Steve Walsh and Kerry Livgren - stated that they would no longer be writing for the band Kansas, explains drummer Phil Ehart. That didn't mean that Kerry might not write a song or two for a special project, but that the two of them were done writing any album length material for Kansas. The four of us decided that we were not done yet, and Native Window was born to scratch that new material itch . Soon after, Ehart found himself with his other Kansas bandmates, Richard Williams (guitar), Billy Greer (vocals/bass), David Ragsdale (violin), to see if the non-Walsh fronted line-up could work. It turns out it certainly can, according to Ehart. We had no idea what it would sound like! We had one criteria - the song had to sound good acoustically. If it sounded good with just acoustic guitar and vocals, then we developed it from there. On June 23rd, Native Window will release their self-titled debut album via StarCity Records (run by Jeff Glixman, who produced some of Kansas best-selling releases). Produced by Steve Rawls and Native Window, the album will certainly grab the attention of longtime Kansas fans, as well as admirers of smartly penned, melodic rock. We could all carry a tune and sing in pitch, says Ehart, But could we actually sound good together? It took some work to get over the hump of singing harmonies, but once we did, you couldn't shut us up! The lyrics were a total group effort. Someone would have a title, a one liner, a chorus, and the lyrics just sprung from there. Sometimes Billy would have a bunch of lyrical ideas, and we'd brainstorm from there. Greer himself also offers nothing but praise about the newly launched band. The writing and recording process on this project was more rewarding and fun than any I have been involved in a very long time. Vocally, this was one of the most challenging and rewarding CD's I have ever recorded! Ehart also cannot stress the importance of having Rawls behind the boards, which served as a catalyst for getting the new group on track and moving forward. Steve Rawls was the guy with us at Real 2 Reel Studios, and made sure we didn't go completely off the deep end in the creative process. He pushed us a lot to try things that were a stretch for us. We couldn't have done this CD without him. Ehart also offers to dispel any rumors that the birth of Native Window may have rubbed Walsh the wrong way. Steve has been very supportive of Native Window since it's inception. He has wished us the best since day one. As fans will learn upon giving Native Window a spin, the long-time Kansas mates have come up with an incredibly consistent album from front to back. This is sentiment that Williams agrees with. Blood in the Water is the most fun to listen to for me. It was truly conceived, moment-to-moment, the four of us sitting in the studio throwing ideas against the wall and using the ones that stuck. On the other hand, much of this CD was done that way. Personally, I like the entire thing. As one of the bands that virtually helped create the now common phrase arena rock, Kansas has sold millions of albums worldwide. Kansas has been a top concert draw since the 1970 s, when they stormed the charts with such hit/classic albums as the quintuple platinum-certified Leftoverture and the quadruple platinum certified Point of Know Return, as well as perennial rock radio favorites Carry On Wayward Son and Dust in the Wind.""]"

Although written around the same time as his brilliant ""Don Juan,"" its materials and working out are far heavier and less distinctive. It is also well played, but Janowski does not seem to like it very much. Weak as the piece is, others have made more of it. -- <i> Turok\'s Choice, Paul Turok, November 2009</i><br /><br />This is a major Strauss release with considerable upside and downside potential. The possible plusses include the fact that it is an excellent coupling of an increasingly popular orchestral showpiece with an underexposed early Strauss tone poem in gorgeous SACD sound. You can make a legitimate case that PentaTone is now consistently making the finest sounding SACDs (especially with the unfortunate recent demise of Telarc) that are quite ideal for Strauss\'s lavish orchestral music. There are also questions. Is the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra a legitimate Strauss ensemble, and is Marek Janowski a serious Strauss interpreter who can hold his own against the formidable competition? In other words, this SACD could be a revelation or a dud. Will this be still another example of a great sounding recording with negligible musical value? Macbeth has always been a somewhat problematical piece. Strauss may have said that it is not really Lisztian, but the music sure sounds like it, along with the addition of a few gentle dissonances. After quickly reaching its first climax, the orchestra hyperventilates its way through a series of alternating loud and soft sections contrasting the themes for Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. The orchestration is dense and not particularly distinguished (at least for Strauss). The orchestra briefly soars in true Straussian fashion at the end, before the final perfunctory chord. Janowski plays Macbeth for all it\'s worth, and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra sounds great. Macbeth has never been recorded in sound like this, even in stereo, let alone multichannel. This is a 19-minute feast of the young Strauss\'s raging orchestra, and for once the critical low strings are clearly articulated despite the large, somewhat reverberant acoustic space. <P>The opening ""Night"" and ""Sunrise"" sections of An Alpine Symphony often tell a lot about how the performance will go from an interpretive and sonic standpoint. The soft brass, winds, and meandering low strings are nicely separated here. There is a curious lack of menace or mystery, but Janowski builds a fairly impressive climax, and for once, the cymbals have the proper bite, shimmer, and decay. The offstage horns are perfectly placed spatially and make an impressive and very musical effect.

Aided by the sound and a vast and airy soundstage that contains the tumult easily, the storm is suitably ferocious. The organ sounds good and is well blended with the orchestra, including the subterranean pedal. Regardless of whether or not it is due to Janowski, the sound, or the relative lack of competition, this Macbeth leads the pack. With An Alpine Symphony, Janowski is up against the big boys. Despite the sound, this is no match for Zubin Mehta (Decca), Rudolf Kempe (Testament), or Mariss Jansons (RCO Live) on SACD. Janowski\'s Alpine Symphony does little to confirm his credentials as a Strauss specialist. -- <i>Fanfare, Arthur Lintgen, Nov/Dec 2009</i>']"

Regardless of whether or not it is due to Janowski, the sound, or the relative lack of competition, this Macbeth leads the pack. With An Alpine Symphony, Janowski is up against the big boys. Despite the sound, this is no match for Zubin Mehta (Decca), Rudolf Kempe (Testament), or Mariss Jansons (RCO Live) on SACD. Janowski\'s Alpine Symphony does little to confirm his credentials as a Strauss specialist. -- <i>Fanfare, Arthur Lintgen, Nov/Dec 2009</i>']"

B002BIGCKQ,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,1,1354406400,The Magic Couple,Amadou & Mariam,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'World Music', 'Africa', 'Mali']","[""The Malian duo Amadou & Mariam Bagayoko, who both hail from Bamako, have become a world music sensation since they began incorporating other traditions, from blues and funk to soul, and even gypsy and rock sounds into their traditional pentatonic scale-based Bamako sound. They sing together and separately (but are best together) in three African languages and French. They are best known in North America for the albums Dimanche a Bamako, recorded in 2008 and 2009s Welcome to Mali, with guests including Toumani Diabat, Damon Albarn, and Keziah Jones. That said, The Magic Couple is a jam-packed, 15-track compilation on Wrasse, that offers a solid representation of at the albums that made them international stars: 1999s Sou Ni Tile, 2000s Tje Ni Mousso, and 2002s international smash Wati. Newer listeners will find in these early tracks that the sound of this duo -- which incorporates literally dozens of players on everything from horns to quanouns, djembes, violins, harmonicas, tamas, Rhodes and Wurlitzer pianos, B-3 organs, and numerous flutes, though Amadous snaky Malian guitar is everywhere, slithering and slipping through these songs -- creates an equally celebratory and incantatory effect, fully developed from the inset. No matter what instruments, musics, or ambiences are woven into the mix, their sound is unmistakably trademarked by their raw but beautiful vocals -- especially Mariam's-- and Amadou's guitar (which was undoubtedly influenced by Ali Farka Tour, but takes that tradition to the next level of evolution). All the cuts here were self-penned, and the sense of timeless folk tradition as it meets both the Modern Eastern and Western worlds is as intoxicating -- perhaps more so -- than on their later recordings. For anyone who's only heard the later records, or is interested in 21st century African music for that matter, The Magic Couple is a must. by Thom Jurek All Music""]"

The title track is transformed into a slice of Latin funk and 'Wild Wild West' into a saloon blues. The quartet Kooshian, tenor saxophonist Jeff Lederer, bassist Tom Hubbard and either Warren Odze or Scott Neumann on drums finds an essence within each of these numbers and rebuilds them from the ground up. Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach's 'God Give Me Strength' retains the original's spirituality but finds its heart in cascading crescendos, while Ellington's 'Purple Gazelle' (from his 1962 Coltrane session, and a.k.a.

Jazz itself has always been open to diverse musical influences. The Pakistani-American Abbasi is involved with an increasingly influential group of musicians of South Asian descent, most notably pianist Vijay Iyer and saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, both of whom appear on &#34;Things To Come&#34;. The addition of Indian classical vocalist Kiran Ahluwalia to the ensemble on a number of pieces adds a unique beauty to this inspiring new recording.', ""If you wanted to make a case for the new Indo-Pak jazz cartel, this record would make a perfect Exhibit A. Not only is its leader, guitarist and composer of Pakistani heritage (born there, raised in L.A.), but it includes the scene's two most prominent figures, alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa and pianist Vijay Iyer. But what makes Things To Come a prime piece of evidence is that it really doesn't sound like it's trying to put too sharp a point on its ethnic particularity. It's too natural to be that heavy-handed. <br><br>The logic of a South Asian music crossover with jazz is clear. They arguably represent the two most developed improvising systems in world culture. The challenge, since the period of the initial Indo-Jazz Fusion experiments in the '60s, has been to find a more integrated way to explore the musics' commonalities. Abbasi is extremely successful in this pursuit. He's an outstanding instrumentalist, no question, but the framework for the playing here is what really catches my ear. With great ease Abbasi creates arrangements with parts in overlapping but different rhythmic cycles, keeping them light and airy so they don't obscure one another. The result, on a track like &#34;Hard Colors,&#34; is a constant set of shifting relationships between the fixed elements, which becomes a springboard for improvisations. <br><br>Whether on resonant, steel-string acoustic or compact-toned, rather compressed electric, Abbasi's playing is a pleasure. His little duet with Indian vocalist Kiran Ahluwalia (who also sings on three other tracks) on the title track offers one very intriguing version of the possible hybird, with unusual, evocative harmonic hues. The linear ideas on tracks like &#34;Why Me Why Them&#34; and &#34;Insulin&#34; remind me a bit of some of Henry Threadgill's writing, especially when articulated by Mahanthappa. His alto playing is out front here and there, as on the impassioned &#34;Realities Of Chromaticism,&#34; and his playing always takes things up a notch.<br><br>Iyer is expert at finding the most unusual rhythmic morsels in a piece. He's got an ability to manage the thunderous chording left hand without having it plod, which is a hazard; hear him manage it with Prokofievian flair on &#34;Dream Suite.&#34; But things To Come is a group realization of a very ambitious batch of compositional notions, and it's the band that brings it home. Bassist Johannes Weidenmueller and drummer Dan Weiss are evanescent, but gravitational, just the ticket for these tricky turns.<br>- John Corbett --DownBeat - Nov. 2009<br /><br />Never mind the guitar chops. The highest compliment that can be paid Rez Abbasi's new release is that it can be recommended on the strength of the compositions alone. <br><br>Not that the Pakistan-born, American-bred virtuoso is going to disappoint those who want to hear him flex his fingers on Things to Come. Remarkable rhythmic and melodic facility, sophisticated harmonic conception, distinctive use of odd intervals to create tension and release, subtle acoustic shadings - those virutes are all on display here, along with the popping tone and fluid thrust that make the guitar improvisation on &#34;Why Me Why Them&#34; worthy of repeat spins. But it's Abbasi's way with a pen, not a pick, that really holds your attention. <br><br>Consisting of eight original pieces, richly textured and often curiously orchestrated, Things to Come blends elements of jazz, funk, South Asian and classical music with engaging ingenuity. Funk-torqued fusion plays a big role on the album, from the surreal opener &#34;Dream State&#34; to the dissonant closer &#34;Insulin.&#34; Yet each piece has a distinct personality, whether it points to postbop influences (&#34;Hard Colors&#34;), reveals Abbasi's close rapport with saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa (&#34;Why Me Why Them&#34;) or quietly showcases Indian vocalist Kiran Ahluwalia's haunting siren call (&#34;Things to Come&#34;).<br><br>In his liner notes Abbasi mentions that he wrote most of this music &#34;away from the guitar,&#34; which is no doubt one of the reasons why the album so fully accomodates the talents of his bandmates and guests: Ahluwalia, Mahanthappa, pianist Vijay Iyer, bassist Johannes Weidenmueller, drummer Dan Weiss and cellist Mike Block - a wonderfully cohesive and inventive lineup. <br>- Mike Joyce --JazzTimes - Nov. 2009""]"

Her career began in opera but her warm personality, her natural gift of communication with every kind of audience, and her ability to perform an amazingly wide range of music soon meant that she was in constant demand away from the opera house for concerts, tours, recordings and television. She has had her own series of shows on both bbc television and classic fm radio, and introduced many outstanding guests including ian bostridge, michael ball, bryn terfel and michel legrand, all of whom appear with her in this album. Lesley has appeared at many landmark events such as the first ever classical brit awards in 2000 and at a concert in the grounds of the royal observatory at greenwich on millennium eve. In 2004 she displayed an outstanding talent for ballroom dancing on the live bbc television series strictly come dancing and she is currently starring in london's west end in a spectacular new production of the musical carousel following her triumph as the abbess in the sound of music at the london palladium. The repertoire in this collection ranges from the much loved aria 'dido's lament' from purcell's opera dido and aeneas, dating from 1689, to brand new compositions by tolga kashif, who also arranged and produced most of the material on this album. There are favourite operatic items by mozart, dvork, puccini and gershwin, familiar folksongs like 'greensleeves', 'o waly, waly' and 'scarborough fair', moving hymns, including 'jerusalem' and 'abide with me' and hits from the musicals les misrables and west side story as well as three of the delightful french songs of the auvergne and a couple of spanish songs.

B002QEXC4E,A2FNBA2IE59Q7V,1,1410307200,Mahler: Symphony No. 2,Gustav Mahler,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Classical', 'Symphonies']","['Haitink Replay: Bernard Haitink has been under fire from certain quarters for re-recording his core-repertory on orchestra-based labels. But Haitink\'s Indian summer in front of the microphones has captured some marvelous performances for posterity. One thinks of the brilliant Beethoven symphony cycle with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO Live), resolute Bruckner in Amsterdam (RCO Live) and Dresden (Hnssler) and his recording accomplishments as principal conductor of the CSO. The symphonies of Gustav Mahler figured prominently in the latter and accounts of Nos 1, 3 and 6 have proven irresistible to demanding collectors of a particularly stoic disposition. This recording of the \'Resurrection\' more than amply justifies the conductor\'s preference for doing what he knows best. It is his finest interpretation of the score and as fine as any on record. <P>Traditions: The tradition of objective Mahler performance was established in the Concertgebouw by Eduard van Beinem by the 1950s. As his successor, Haitink maintained this luminescent objectivity and passed it on intact to Riccardo Chailly in due course. Bernard Haitink made two studio recordings of Mahler\'s Second with the RCO (1968) and the BPO (1993) for Philips. Yet his previous best performance can be found only on a Netherlands domestic product in the Philips Dutch Master series. The broadcast relay tape revealed that Haitink could be a very different conductor in concert than in the studio. The account of December 25, 1984 was revelatory. And the present recording from November 2008 is even better with the added advantage of the latest advances in engineering. Haitink also made a decisive contribution to the restoration of another important tradition: the dark and deep-rooted Central European tone of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. CSO Resound conveys in full the sonorities which made the orchestra famous under Reiner and Solti. The CSO is back in form and once again audibly unique among American orchestras. May Bernard Haitink long continue to record what he wants, when he wants ...and aren\'t we lucky? -- <i>Classical Music Sentinel, Stephen Habington, February 2010</i><br /><br />In Issue 206, TC complained that a shattering performance of Shostakovich\'s Fourth Symphony by Haitink and the Chicago Symphony was not recorded in the latest technology, SACD. Someone evidently listened, for Mahler\'s Second Symphony, performed by the same conductor and orchestra, is (hybrid SACD CSOR 901 916, two discs). It is a beautifully played performance, with great balances and dynamic range (most of the symphony is soft, and the Chicago responds impressively), although far from a shattering interpretation. The soloists, soprano Miah Persson and mezzo Christianne Stotijn are fine. The last movement is where the performance falters most. When it finally picks up speed, Haitink does not drive the orchestra energetically. When the chorus comes in, the tempo is slow enough that the changes from duple to triple meter (one of the most forward-looking moments in the piece) are not perceptible. (The only SACD performance where they are is Gergiev on LSO Live, which TC recommends.) -- <i>Turok\'s Choice, Paul Turok, March 2010</i><br /><br />Rating: 5 stars I started out not liking this much. But--this is usually the case when I hear this symphony in a new recording for the first time. Mahler has the curse of suffering a great largesse of interpretative nuance, and this, his most popular work, is the one that gets the most critical scrutiny. It was his first great success, even though it was written piecemeal over a five year period. There are so many warning signs in this for me, so many things that have to be just right, that if they are not I get disappointed. As a result, there are very few recordings of this work that truly satisfy me. <P>The greatest I have ever heard is Bernstein\'s radio broadcast from the Blossom Music Festival with the Cleveland Orchestra in the summer of 1970, the one and only time he ever conducted that orchestra. It is a sensational performance, and should be released by the Clevelanders immediately (I haven\'t heard it on the radio for about 15 years or so). The same conductor\'s New York recording from 1963 still sets somewhat of a standard, though the sound was long ago passed. It\'s not bad--I haven\'t heard the newly-remastered version of that great and historical series (though what I have heard makes me shy away--apparently there is a great deal more treble. I have the box from 2001 that also includes the Kindertotenlieder with Janet Baker, something the new set does not) so I can\'t compare with the new one, but even here the sound is good enough to present Mahler in his full-blown glory. <P>One of my first issues is the opening accelerando in the upward-scaled strings. So many conductors artificially start this off at a slower tempo in order to make that speed-up. This is not what Mahler called for, and Bernstein gets it right. So does Levi (Telarc), Slatkin (Telarc), and Tilson-Thomas (SF). The other critical issue is the sound of the chorus in the final passages of the last movement; if this is not overwhelmingly glorious, I feel let down. Yoel Levi and Atlanta have hands-down the most glorious finale on record; it is stunning to hear, even if it is not in SA. This recording is something of a benchmark, and more people should know it. It and the Bernstein have the best finales, though Levi is more deliberate than Lenny, who makes some beautifully pointed episodes in almost all of the movements. His choral work on the later DGG recording is also very well recorded, though he adds a much slower conclusion to the descending chromatic scale at the end of the first movement, while Levi mimics Bernstein\'s 1963 recording and takes it at a rapid tempo. I would not be without either of these two readings. <P>So what of this new Chicago issue with the venerable Bernard Haitink? Since it is in SACD, I think it only fair to compare like to like. Zinman (RCA) is the cleanest on record, almost too clean, and at times his otherwise excellent Tonhalle Orchestra of Zurich sounds thin in the strings. He is no-nonsense all the way, as you might expect. The much heralded Ivan Fischer (Channel Classics) and his Budapest Festival Orchestra (especially for Mahler\'s Forth, which I have not heard) is not as clear as Zinman, but more exciting, though neither he nor Zinman get the opening right. Fischer\'s finale is more exhilarating and very well sung, though lacking the punch of Levi. There are a few overdone, rather ""tubby"" sounding moments as well, especially in the percussion. Slatkin\'s Telarc is now released in SA, though only two-channel, but Telarc\'s ""Soundstream"" process really packs a wallop. (If you want to do a really interesting comparison, listen to the Atlanta/Shaw Carmina Burana in regular CD and then SA--the difference, even though still in two channel, is astounding.) <P>We have to turn to Tilson-Thomas to find a really first-rate SA Second. His San Francisco players are beautifully captured in lifelike sound, somewhat recessed compared to these others, but on a wide stage with pristine sonics. Thomas gets the opening absolutely correct and has a suitably moving ending, though again not quite as powerful as the Levi. But this is definitely one of the top-rank Mahler twos. The new Chicago is done by a master Mahlerian who has spent a lifetime with the work. Haitink, in the short time he has been in Chicago, has managed to bring a more silken sound to the string section, never known for its lustrous tone. Don\'t get me wrong, they are better than 95% of the strings sections out there, but compared to Philly/Ormandy they don\'t come close (who did for that matter?). But I like what I hear here, and they have a fine Mahler sound to them, coarser when needed, but also capable of great beauty in the longer lines. The winds and brass are just about perfect, playing to the traditional strengths of this orchestra. <P>This is not a version I am recommending because of its great interpretative insights; in fact, it is rather relaxed. Haitink\'s tempos are very deliberate (I won\'t say ""slow""), almost as if he is wallowing in the impressionistic aspects of Mahler\'s score just to revel in the sonorities. He also misses the opening like Fischer and others. No--what makes me rate this version highly is the magnificent sound, surely the best this symphony has ever received. The breadth and depth of the soundstage have to be heard to be believed, rich, warm, and so full of sonic potency. You can almost imagine a third dimension to it, so vivid does it come across. Another reason is the chorus, the second greatest in America (sorry, the Atlanta Symphony Chorus still reigns supreme), and no surprise since it was founded by a Robert Shaw student (Margaret Hillis), later an assistant conductor of Shaw\'s Collegiate Chorale before assuming Chicago duties. The current standards have been kept high by Chorus Director Duain Wolfe. The voices are set wonderfully, and the finale pages belong among the greats of recorded history. I might mention the two solo singers are also excellent. <P>This is not your one-and-only Mahler 2; the interpretation won\'t stand up to that scrutiny. You have to have Bernstein, Levi, and Thomas. But this is a milestone, and audiophiles will salivate. All others will simply be in for a heck of a ride. -- <i>Audiophile Audition, Steven Ritter, January 1, 2010</i><br /><br />S\'il y a un cycle in progress des symphonies de Mahler  suivre pour ceux qui n\'aiment (ou ne connaissent) pas Mahler, c\'est bien celui de Haitink. Bien qu\'il russisse  produire des fortissimi spectaculaires, on ne peut pas dire qu\'il dcoiffe ou drange pour autant - psychologiquement, s\'entend. Il nous donne plutt un Mahler accessible, pos, voire agrable, avec un sens de la forme qui se rvle tre le vritable testament intellectuel de ce grand chef. Le tout jumel  une opulente palette orchestrale (coutez ces cuivres graves dans le dernier mouvement!), un registre dynamique et des solistes intressants, quoique pas parfaitement complmentaires (le trmolo serr de Persson drange un peu, mais son timbre lger est idal pour Urlicht). Un bel achat, assurment. -- <i> La Scena Musicale, Ren Bricault, February 2010</i><br /><br />The CSO and Haitink have recorded Mahler\'s monumental symphony twice but never before with each other. Their latest album stems from performances given at Orchestra Hall in November 2008. The vivid sound picture lends an added sense of occasion to the reading. Haitink\'s reading hangs fire until the Day of Judgment bursts forth thrillingly; elsewhere one misses the intensity Claudio Abbado and Georg Solti brought to their CSO recordings. <P>That said, the refinement of detail achieved by Haitink is superb. And the majestic choral evocation of heavenly rebirth elicits a gloriously full and expressive sound from the 150-voice chorus. Mezzo Christianne Stotijn delivers a warmly confiding &#34;Urlicht.&#34; Not a first-choice recommendation, then, but worth having for Haitink\'s autumnal insights and the magnificent playing and choral singing. -- <i> Chicago Tribune, John von Rhein, November 26, 2009</i><br /><br />The Chicago Symphony Orchestra probably can play this symphony by heart, and certainly its fabled brass (particularly trombones and horns), as well as the superb chorus, give the big moments the weight that they require. The problem is that the rest of the orchestra--not to mention Bernard Haitink--seems not to be making a similar effort. As an interpreter, Haitink remains a cypher. This is at least his fourth authorized recording of this symphony, and while it\'s not quite as dull as his Berlin remake for Philips, it contains neither a single distinctive interpretive idea nor an atom of passion. <P>While up to tempo, there\'s no sense of struggle in the first movement, no menace in its coda, no quirky humor in the scherzo, and the finale lacks any sense of urgency--it particularly hangs fire as soon as the chorus enters. The &#34;cry of despair&#34; in the third movement is impressive because the orchestra knows how it goes, not because Haitink takes any trouble to make something special of it. Similarly the final chorale has impact because the chorus sings wonderfully, and the organ pedals are well caught by the otherwise low-level recording. <P>But where is the bite to the cellos and basses at the symphony\'s opening, the vigor in the finale\'s &#34;dead march&#34;, or the transcendent power of the final pages (almost no bells, by the way)? It\'s Haitink on autopilot, as he so often seems to be these days. Among the soloists Christianne Stotijn turns in a lovely &#34;Urlicht&#34;, but Miah Persson\'s voice lacks the necessary purity to float over the choir in her first two entrances in the finale. <P>This is nothing more than a respectable, workaday subscription performance that any paying concertgoer surely would have enjoyed, but it has no business being preserved and issued on disc. Haitink\'s finest &#34;Resurrection&#34; by far remains his first, more as a classic example of a great Mahler orchestra\'s characteristic style in the 1960s than for anything he brings to the party. His later performances prove convincingly that most of the credit for the excellence of that first version does not rest with the conductor. There is something to be said for his naturally self-effacing approach, his willingness to let the music &#34;speak for itself&#34;--but then, why keep recording it over and over? Enough already. -- <i>Classics Today, David Hurwitz, November 2009</i><br /><br />The most recent release from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Resound label is an impressive recording of Mahler\'s Second Symphony. Based on performances given in late November 2008, this recording preserves the memorable readings CSO principal conductor Bernard Haitink gave this work last year. While comparisons can be awkward, the previous point of reference for CSO audiences was the series of performances by Michael Tilson Thomas in early 2006. At that time Tilson Thomas conducted the work dynamically, but some elements did not emerge readily as, for example, the portamento in the strings in the second movement. Haitink\'s approach may be characterized as attentive to the details of the score, and his mastery of those various elements has resulted in an intensely moving interpretation. While it is possible to distinguish the first three instrumental movements from the last two vocal ones, Haitink fused the five movements into a convincing whole in the concerts he gave in Fall 2008. It may be difficult, at times, to perceive such cohesiveness in a recording, since listeners can stop and start at various points. Nevertheless, the disc captures the style Haitink achieved in live concerts in a fine recording of Mahler\'s Second Symphony. In this recording, it is possible to hear the attention to detail which Haitink brought to those live performances. Such integrity allowed the score to play as intended by the composer, an intention implicit in the various revisions Mahler made after the premiere of the Second in 1894 - particularly the refinements he published in the 1906 edition of the score. From the start Haitink made the work resonate, with the tremolo with which the first movement opens as intense as a climactic moment in an opera. The opening tempo is engaging, and Haitink is able to propel the movement forward by drawing from the orchestra nicely etched articulations at cadences and other structurally important places, as indicated in the score. He broadens the tempo when necessary and, when marked in the score, allows various passages to push forward. The swells of sound Mahler orchestrated have a clear shape, as the sonorities build to fullness and decay naturally. While some of this ambience may be the result of the acoustics of the hall, the tight ensemble of the CSO must be acknowledged as the source of the solid and mature sound in this masterful performance. With the strings at the core, the orchestra offers equally strong sonorities from the woodwinds and brass. At the same time, the percussion deserves recognition for the effective use of the timpani, along with support from the non-tuned instruments. With its immediate and upfront sound in this recording, the softer passages are never lost in the mix; however the tutti passages at the end of the first section of the first movement, to cite one example, can be overwhelming. The passages which conclude the movement reveal an appropriate pacing, with the final gesture bringing the movement to a resounding conclusion. While some labels issue Mahler\'s Second Symphony on a single disc, CSO Resound offers it on two, with the one devoted to the first movement, the piece Mahler once entitled ""Todtenfeier,"" in the manner of a tone poem Mahler once intended for the piece. The remaining four movements are found on the second of the two CDs. This division also assists in adhering to the marking Mahler put in the score to allow some time before proceeding with the second movement. In the medium of a sound recording, this physical separation supports that kind of stage direction. Likewise, the placement of the second through fifth movements on the second disc helps to prevent any kind of artificial separation of the instrumental movements from the vocal ones. In contrast to the dramatic effect Haitink brings out in the first movement, the second conveys a delicacy implicit in the score. This emerges not only in the softer, more restrained playing, but in the clean articulations of the accompanying figures. In a similar way, the woodwinds are not just soft, as marked in the score, but seem sotto voce in approach, with a reedy blend prominent in the second section of the movement. With the return of the first area, Haitink\'s hesitant gestures helped to distort the expected melodic pattern before the variation proceeds. Even within the delicate shadings of the movement, full sounds of the central section never seemed to be a compromise. Rather, the plaintive effect fits into the sometimes elegiac character of the movement. The Scherzo in Haitink\'s hands is relatively brisk, and the tempos convey a sense of the instrumental idiom of the movement. While the music from Mahler\'s Wunderhorn setting Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt (""St. Anthony of Padua\'s Sermon to the Fish"") is recognizable, Haitink allows the other ideas in the movement to emerge easily from that vocal model. Those brisk tempos set up the middle section of the movement, where the brass fanfare introduces music by Mahler\'s deceased colleague Hans Rott, specifically the opening of the Scherzo from the Rott\'s Symphony in E. When the thematic content from both Rott\'s Scherzo and Mahler\'s Wunderhorn song combine near the end of the movement, Haitink sustains the tension of the orchestral outburst sufficiently to allow the remainder of the movement to dissipate naturally. The quieter sounds and thinner textures at the end of the Scherzo fit nicely into the chamber-music-like sonorities at the beginning of Urlicht, the fourth movement. In this movement Christianne Stotijn uses her full mezzo sound to color the text from Des Knaben Wunderhorn. Her voice blends well with the middle-string sounds, yet is never obscured within the orchestral textures. The calm and paced song gives way, in turn, to the choral Finale, and in this movement Haitink delivers a compelling reading of Mahler\'s cantata-like structure which centers on the famous ""Auferstehungs"" Ode of Klopstock. The contrasts found in the score are realized nicely in this recording, with the thunderous opening of the movement serving as a foil for the relatively quiet sounds from the off-stage brass which follow and, later, the development of the opening theme on solo instruments. Haitink restrains the horns in the first part of the movement, with the fanfares from that section quite rich in color, but never as prominent as they are later in the movement. Likewise, the low brass are wonderfully clear and resonant, without overbalancing the ensemble - not only in the reprise of the ""O Roschen rot"" idea from Urlicht, but also later, Mahler develops motifs around the interval of the tritone. Ultimately, the repose which accompanies the instrumental presentation of the Aufterstehungs-Motif from the third act of Wagner\'s Siegfried (the passage in which the character Brnnhilde sings &#34;Ewig war ich, ewig bin ich&#34; -- &#34;I was eternal, I am eternal&#34;) serves as a further foil for the various off-stage and solo instruments in the section before the a capella chorus enters. At this point, it is difficult to recall a more satisfying interpretation of the choral entrance with the words ""Aufersteh\'n, ja aufersteh\'n, wirst du, mein Staub"" (""Arise, yes, arise, my dust""), with the vocal textures full and rich. Miah Persson\'s soprano solo plays off the choral timbre with ease and assurance as her passages emerge clearly. When Persson interacts with Stotijn in the duet which follows, both women\'s voices blend well in conveying not only the meaning of the text but also the emotional pitch of the music. This sets the tone for the choral sections which follow. The full sounds of the male voices are impressive for the textured sonorities they create. Haitink is good to allow the passage ""Bereite dich"" to resonate, and then to linger on the passages that follow. In such a way, the text and music build to a fitting and appropriate conclusion, which climaxes on the phrase ""Sterben werd\' ich um zu leben"" (""I perish in order to live"") before the reprise of the text ""Aufersteh\'n, ja aufersteh\'n"" (""Arise, yes arise""). Here the combined sounds of the chorus, soloists, and orchestra have free rein in bringing this monumental work to its conclusion, as Mahler creates a vocal tableau as the culmination of his Second Symphony. The recording does justice to the performances on which it is based, and also points to the affinity between Haitink and the CSO when it comes to interpreting Mahler\'s music. This recording is a worthy addition to the already fine set of recordings from these performers, which include the two symphonies which frame this one, the First and Third, as well as Haitink\'s incisive recording of Mahler\'s Sixth Symphony. Whether these will result in a cycle is less important than the fine interpretations each recording contributes to the legacy of recordings for these works. With this newly issued disc, Haitink and the CSO offer a powerful reading of this important score. It stands apart from others not only for the interpretation Haitink offers but also for the execution of the score by one of the finest orchestras in the world. Available both on CD on a two-disc set and also as a download, this recording bears careful listening for the detailed reading it brings to Mahler\'s familiar score. -- <i>MusicWeb International, James L. Zychowicz, December 2009</i><br /><br />There\'s something fitting and timely about listening to Mahler\'s Symphony No. 2, (&#34;Resurrection). Like the times, the work is ominous in tone and all about troubled transfiguration. And one of the best recordings to connect with that sentiment is this latest outing by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. <P>With this disc, the CSO gives a super-balanced performance of a tough work. But fans of highly dramatic interpretations of Mahler beware. This recording eschews a go-for-the-jugular sonic approach in favor of something finely shaped and less than fast. Here all nuances, big or small, are honored, even in the apocalyptic last movement. <P>Credit for this well-drawn performance must be given to conductor Bernard Haitink. His sophisticated and sensitive approach may be due to Haitink being 80 years old. His august approach steers the orchestra into a relaxed pace, but one that does not lose urgency. <P>That sets up an environment where the musical minutiae are allowed to bloom. In the sinister- sounding first movement, the music is dark and weighty, but never sodden. The fine orchestral playing that is the CSO\'s trademark is heard in the Andante, wherein winds, strings and brass sound super-clear and clean, regardless of whether the playing is loud or pianissimo. <P>In the Mahler canon, there\'s nothing more spine-tingling than the whispered entrance of the chorus in the last movement. And on this recording, the seamless way those hushed voices evolve into the earth- shattering finale makes this a must-have recording. <P>This CD also boasts the radiant mezzo-soprano of Christianne Stotijn. -- <i>The Sacramento Bee, Edward Ortiz, January 25, 2010</i><br /><br />This fourth installment in Haitink\'s CSO Mahler series perfectly captures the atmosphere and drama of the composer\'s sprawling musical depiction of life, death and rebirth. Duain Wolfe\'s CSO Chorus scales the cosmic heights in the finale. -- <i>Daily Herald, Bill Gowen, January 2010</i><br /><br />With this triumphant new ""Resurrection,"" Bernard Haitink and the Chicago Symphony add the central pillar to the trilogy of early Mahler symphonies. Mahlerites everywhere can be very thankful to the Chicago Symphony organization and CSO Resound for thus documenting this important and illuminating series; I\'m sure I\'m not alone in the hope that it continues. In the first movement, Haitink projects clarity over power with an opening that doesn\'t take you by the throat: this music is wary, almost tentative, as though dreading what is to come; in short, this isn\'t the Chicago Symphony of Solti\'s Decca recordings, a powerhouse bowling you over with the sheer impact of its sound. Haitink is after a more complex tonal structure, probing the contest between Mahler\'s two thematic strands with precision. Shimmering violin tremolos and plaintive oboes characterize the pastoral, major-mode music, and stern basses and portentous brass energize the minor mode theme. While the excitement quotient is lower than that of Fischer on Channel, the coherence of Haitink\'s vision is preferable to Gergiev on LSO Live. Michael Tilson Thomas is more overtly dramatic, and his SFS recording projects a more dynamic sound picture than this new one does. Like MTT, Haitink\'s set isolates the first movement on disc 1, allowing the listener to more easily honor Mahler\'s request for a pause of at least five minutes\' duration before the next movement. The second movement begins in a stately, elegant, and flowing fashion. The Chicago strings are full-bodied, the sections clearly differentiated in the production (Haitink seats the violins together, basses and cellos to the right). Altogether, this movement represents an affectionately nostalgic portrait of the hero of Mahler\'s original program. The Scherzo is all sinuous grace, and one marvels again at the variety and character of Mahler\'s orchestration, reproduced with such care here. The grand two-part chorale that ushers in the trio is just pompous enough, while the trio is gentle and saccharin-free. The premonition of the finale is a sudden and effective injection of Chicago muscle. The success of ""Urlicht"" is all about the individual soloist, and MTT has set a difficult new standard to match by choosing the incomparable Lorraine Hunt Lieberson. Christianne Stotijn\'s is a youthful-sounding mezzo, however, and her purity of tone is perfectly suited to the declaration of faith embodied in the text. The finale is ushered in with a deep-throated roar, faithfully reproduced by the engineers, another taste of the power mostly held in reserve in this performance. The ""voice crying in the wilderness"" is nicely distanced (as is the later offstage band), a harbinger of things to come. Somber tones give way to the first suggestion of the Resurrection, as the brass blaze forth. The spacious sound effortlessly accommodates Mahler\'s expanding sonic palette, as the ""opening of the graves"" ushers in the Resurrection march. The ""Great Call"" is heard, the offstage trumpet fanfares answer the entreaties of the flute, and then the chorus enters. The CSO Chorus is one to envy, powerful, articulate, and always musical. Miah Persson, heard in Fischer\'s Mahler Fourth, is a splendid soprano soloist, and Stotijn\'s reappearance here is most welcome. The final ""Aufersteh\'n"" is rousing, climactic, and totally convincing, with the organ a potent presence. In SACD, MTT still tops my recommendation list, but this new CSO Resound recording can comfortably share the same shelf as the Fischer, and rates above those by Gergiev, Norrington, and Zinman. In stereo, Eschenbach\'s Philadelphia set (Ondine) is a worthy complement to Haitink\'s new one from Chicago. -- <i>Fanfare, Christopher Abbot, Mar-Apr 2010</i>']"

What really impresses, though, is the tenderness and poetry that are so often overlooked in Prokofiev, and not just in the love music. Gergiev frequently lets the strings and solo woodwind linger in a beguiling natural rubato, whilst maintaining an architectural grasp of the tragic whole. The shaping of the Epilogue wrings the heart, with the LSO exhibiting exceptional control. Strongly recommended.'' --BBC Music Magazine<br /><br />FIVE STARS - ''Rarely does a new recording supersede all before it, but that is the case with the LSO's new performance of Prokofiev's ballet score, Romeo & Juliet.

The lightness of his touch and the consistent clarity of his bow strokes are quite admirable in themselves, but when combined with an uncanny sweetness of tone in the higher registers they are breathtaking.\' Gramophone <P>A Frenchman in St Petersburg ... Gautier Capuon joins Valery Gergiev (making his Virgin Classics debut) and the Mariinsky Orchestra for works by Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev These live performances were recorded in St Petersburg on 24th December 2008 when Gautier Capuon was the guest of Russia\'s leading maestro - and one of the world\'s most prominent conductors - the protean Valery Gergiev and his Mariinsky Orchestra. <P>This is Gergiev\'s debut on Virgin Classics; Capuon, of course, is one of the mainstays of the label and this is his third album of solo works with orchestra. <P>His recording of the Dvok and Victor Herbert concertos was released in early 2009. The Sunday Telegraph reported that: ""This is not the first coupling of these works, but it is perhaps the most distinguished. The works have much in common and Gautier Capuon makes the most of the music\'s melodic appeal. The Dvok receives a powerful and intense interpretation with some superb orchestral solos to match the soloist\'s eloquence,"" while The Guardian found that, in the Herbert, Capuon ""captures the work\'s rhapsodic ambitions and the lyrical charm of its slow movement perfectly ... this version just about has it all."" <P>Gautier joined his brother, violinist Renaud for a recording of the Brahms Double Concerto, released in 2007. ""There\'s something totally compelling about this performance of the Double Concerto from the first few bars,"" wrote The Guardian, ""when Gautier Capuon launches into the opening cello solo with a rhapsodic freedom and expressive abandon that seems to sweep all before it, gathering first his brother Renaud\'s violin playing and then the Gustav Mahler Jugend Orchestra and conductor Myung-Whun Chung into the same unstoppable flood of lyricism."" <P>Tchaikovsky\'s Mozart-inspired Rococo Variations are a mainstay of the cello repertoire, but Prokofiev\'s Sinfonia Concertante features less frequently in concerts and recordings. The work was premiered in 1952 by Mstislav Rostropovich, with the equally legendary pianist Sviatoslav Richter deserting the keyboard for the conductor\'s baton. Its material is drawn from the composer\'s earlier cello concerto, written in the 1930s.']"

The finale, deft, vigorous and full of joy, is sure to impress.' Gramophone Magazine <P>Sir Simon Rattle rose to international prominence as conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and since 2002 has been principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic. <P>Born in Liverpool, Rattle studied piano and violin, and his early work with orchestras was as a percussionist. His time with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra from 1980 to 1998 drew him to the attention of critics and the public. Rattle increased both his profile and that of the orchestra over his tenure. Rattle made his conducting debut with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1987, and in 1999, he was appointed as successor to Claudio Abbado as the orchestra's principal conductor. <P>The recordings of Sir Simon Rattle's cycle of the Mahler Symphonies commenced in 1986 with the Second Symphony and was completed in 2002 with the Fifth. During that time Sir Simon's period as chief conductor of the CBSO came to an end and he took up his current position with the Berlin Philharmonic. <P>Rattle's Mahler interpretations are widely acknowledged by huge, worldwide critical acclaim and many of these recordings are among the best available versions. Indeed, most of them have received awards from some of the world's most prestigious music publications and organisations, among them Gramophone in the UK; Diapason in France, Grammy in the US as well as awards from Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and the Czech Republic. <P>The Fifth is markedly different from its predecessors. Mahler's capacity for renewal is astonishing and no two symphonies are alike, and hardly any of the fifty movements within those symphonies follow the same pattern. The Fifth is purely instrumental and it follows a largely conventional symphonic shape. <P>EMI MASTERS celebrates the full glory of the greatest performances from the world's greatest catalogue of recorded music. Digitally remastered at Abbey Road Studios direct from the original master tapes, these classic recordings emerge with unparalleled immediacy. You will be left in no doubt that you are in the presence of legendary musicians and ageless interpretations.""]"

Written during World War II, the unusually constructed Eighth Symphony is a powerful work built on striking contrasts betwee', '""...My first encounter with Vasily Petrenko\'s Shostakovich cycle has proved to be a rewarding experience. It seems to me that he really has the measure of this epic work and he\'s conveyed his vision to the orchestra who reward him with consistently top quality playing. The recorded sound is very good, as is the documentation, including an evocative photograph on the booklet cover, showing the composer at work on this very symphony in 1943. This powerful, stirring performance would be a leading library contender at full price. At the Naxos price its claims on collectors\' attentions are even greater. I eagerly await further instalments in this cycle, especially the Fourth and Tenth symphonies."" -- <i>Music Web International - John Quinn</i><br /><br />The Eighth Symphony of Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-1975) was composed in the summer of 1943 as Soviet forces turned the tide of war with their decisive victory at the Battle of Kursk. Though it is less well-know than its much-hyped predecessor, the garish ""Leningrad"" Symphony, it is in all respects a far superior work. The epic five-movement structure of the Eighth is balanced on a pair of memorable Scherzo movements that move from biting sarcasm to sheer terror, flanked by a poignant 25-minute opening movement and a finale terminating in an atmosphere of serene resignation. The ambiguous, highly personal language of the work was criticized for its dearth of overt patriotism and was poorly received. Christened the ""Stalingrad"" Symphony by Soviet propagandists, performances of the work were officially banned in 1948 and the work was not heard again in Russia until 1956. <P>This superb Naxos disc marks the third installment of a very promising series of Shostakovich symphonies conducted by Vasily Petrenko with the Liverpool Philharmonic. Though a mere 34 years old, the Russian maestro clearly has the Liverpool ensemble in his thrall. With his uncanny knack for drawing together the disparate elements of Shostakovich\'s prolix language into a coherent argument and an equally fine ear for subtle interpretive details, Petrenko makes a very strong impression indeed. The recording is bright and spacious, the performance is excellent, and the price can\'t be beat. -- <i>The Whole Note, Daniel Foley </i>']"

Well, some of us do; some of us need even more. This Bach-itis has led me to collect more than 1,000 discs of Bach, and, while I\'ve slowed down on purchases in recent years, I do pick up some new Bach recordings every now and then, notably the recently concluded set of cantatas recorded by John Eliot Gardiner (review). But do you really need all this music? Perhaps you\'re a casual fan of Bach\'s music and you want more. You could buy individual CDs, filling your collection slowly, looking for the best versions of each work. This is time-consuming and expensive. Or you could buy a complete set of Bach\'s music, offering you the ability to sample all of this great composer\'s works, then, if you find affinities with specific works and want to seek out other versions, do so. I\'ve long been a fan of the latter approach, especially since Brilliant Classics has shaken up the classical music business with their very low priced box sets of complete (or collected) works of various composers. In fact, the first big Brilliant Classics box I got was their set of Bach recordings, released back in 2001. (review). This is a mixed bag, with some excellent recordings, but quite a few mediocre discs. While I initially felt the cantata recordings to be good, more recent recordings (by Gardiner, Suzuki and others) have put them near the back of the pack. This brings me to the subject at hand:, the Hnssler set of Bach recordings, which the label organized around 2000, during the celebrations for the 250th anniversary of Bach\'s death. At first, Hnssler set out to fill out their Bach recordings, which were built around Helmuth Rilling\'s set of the sacred cantatas. They enlisted Rilling to oversee the set, and came up with a wonderful collection of 172 CDs in 140 volumes (a number of the volumes contain 2 or 3 discs). After releasing them individually, they then sold a box set, at what was then considered a normal price, but since the advent of Brilliant Classics pricing, seemed expensive. Hnssler has now re-issued this set in a space-saving box at a ""nice"" price, or 299. The set is currently available for around $300 in the US, less than 200 in the UK, and around 225 elsewhere in the EU. Let\'s start by looking at what you get in the box. It\'s a big box, sleek and well-designed, and, as you can see in the illustration to this review, opens to show the CDs in three sections. Each CD is in a paper and glassine sleeve, and is well labelled. The CDs have colour coding for the different types of works (cantatas, sacred music, organ, keyboard, instrumental), and each bears a large volume number and a title. The discs are therefore easy to find and choose from the box. There are also two booklets: one is a full catalogue of the set, by disc, with track-listings; this runs to nearly 300 pages. The second is an index by BWV number, which then points you to specific discs. Finally, there is a CD-ROM with complete texts of the vocal music, extensive notes and detailed track and artist information. These are provided in 14 PDF files that you can view on any computer. They contain the full notes that you would expect to receive with CDs, in German, English, French and Spanish, and total some 5,000 CD-sized pages. Hnssler has clearly not scrimped on the documentation, and one should actually expect this with any big box set. In reality such high-quality documentation is, alas, rare. There are nearly 178 hours of music in this box, which is a daunting prospect for anyone. Even fans of Bach will find some works that don\'t interest them much - perhaps the eight discs of chorale settings, which have not been recorded often, yet contain some gems - but choosing either to traverse the set in order, or at random, yields many excellent recordings. Back in 2000, during the wonderful Bach year, I bought a number of the individual Hnssler discs to fill out my collection. This was in part because, at the time, there were not a lot of choices for some of the less common works, but also because of the excellent quality of these recordings. I notably purchased many of the keyboard recordings, and some of them have become my favourites. I\'d note especially Trevor Pinnock\'s superlative recording of the Partitas; Peter Watchorn\'s great Toccatas disc; and the Well-Tempered Clavier recorded by Robert Levin in a unique manner, with different works played on harpsichord, clavichord, organ and fortepiano. Naturally, at nearly one-third of the box, the sacred cantatas are form the biggest chunk here. They are arguably Bach\'s finest works, together with the secular cantatas (eight discs) and the other sacred vocal works (passions, masses, motets and oratorios) which cover 16 discs. This is where this box is simply a bargain. Helmuth Rilling is an excellent conductor and interpreter of Bach\'s sacred music. While I have a preference for John Eliot Gardiner\'s cantata recordings, because of his forces and his more HIP choices, there is no doubt that Rilling\'s recordings are excellent. Recorded from 1969 to 1985, over a longer period of time than most other sets, there is a lot of change throughout the series. Rilling\'s recordings are more dense and lush than others, and his tempi are often slower than HIP recordings - no ""original instruments"" for Rilling. But he creates such a detailed sound-world that any fan of these works should want to hear Rilling\'s versions to compare with others. This said, Rilling often uses a technique that I find a bit disturbing. He\'ll have one instrument or group of instruments sequestered to one track, and others on the other track, giving a sound similar to that of early Beatles\' stereo mixes, where vocals were on one track and instruments on the other. This is something you never hear in live performance; while one instrument may be on one side, you still hear it on the other side. This tends to make some of the movements sound as though there\'s no blend among the singers and musicians. It\'s worth noting that, in some cases, re-takes were made months after initial recordings of some movements of the cantatas, and the sound can vary from one part of a cantata to another. But this doesn\'t detract from the overall tone. One more point: the actual recording quality of these works varies, and is generally not as clean as that of more recent cantata recordings using newer technology. While this is a minor detail, it can be obvious if you compare different recordings of a given cantata. Rilling notably has an excellent collection of singers in the sacred works. To name but a few that stand out: Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Arleen Augr, Helen Watts, Edith Wiens, Peter Schreier, Philipp Huttenlocher, Matthias Goerne, Juliane Banse, Thomas Quasthoff, Christoph Prgardien and many more. And Rilling\'s choirs are always top-notch. The same can be said for the other sacred works, the passions, oratorios and masses. So far I\'ve barely scratched the surface, even though the sacred vocal works are the heart of the collection. The organ works fill 20 CDs, the keyboard works 32, 11 discs of chamber music, 11 discs of orchestral music, and 4 discs of alternate versions of cantatas. There\'s a very attractive recording of the Musical Offering, on a variety of instruments: fortepiano, harpsichord, viola da gamba, flute and violin. Robert Hill\'s recording of The Art of Fugue on harpsichord is brilliant, and includes early versions of some of the fugues; the notes explain the different versions, and tell you how you can program the tracks in such a way as to listen to the two different versions of the work. One disc contains reconstructed violin concertos performed by Isabelle Faust. Another fine recording, again by Robert Hill, shows off the rarely recorded lute-harpsichord. Hille Perl and Michael Beringer play the sonatas for viola da gamba and harpsichord. And the Oregon Bach Festival Chamber Orchestra, led by Helmuth Rilling, plays the Brandenburg Concertos and Orchestral Suites; certainly not my favourite versions, but fine ones nevertheless. One of the only elements I find missing is versions of The Art of Fugue for organ and for chamber orchestra. Some criticisms are in order, though. Boris Pergamenschikow\'s cello suites are ponderous; Dmitry Sitkovetsky\'s solo violin recordings are a bit better, but not up to the competition. These are two of my favourite groups of Bach\'s works, and I turn to other recordings when I want to listen to them. The organ works are performed by seven different organists, playing in different locations. Organ recordings often try to vary their sound by using different organs, and the sound is different from one to another, as is the style. In some ways I would have preferred a single organist, even at different locations, but this isn\'t a deal-breaker. So, back to my initial question: do you need this set? It depends on how Bach-obsessed you are. If you\'re familiar with Rilling\'s cantata recordings, and appreciate them, then this set is worth getting if only for those discs - which do make up more than a third of the set. If you have a lot of Bach and want more, then the answer is obvious. And if you don\'t have a lot of Bach, and want to discover all of his works in recordings that range from very good to excellent you can\'t go wrong. Comparing this set to the Brilliant Classics box, I would certainly give higher grades to Hnssler. It is more expensive, but I think it\'s a much more worthwhile investment than the more uneven Brilliant Classics set. No matter what, at about $1.50, 1 or 1.30 a disc, if you care about Bach enough to want this much music, you owe it to yourself to get this set. Add it to your Christmas list, perhaps, or buy yourself a present. -- <i>MusicWeb International, Kirk McElhearn, November 2010</i>']"

The young duke, Francesco II, was a cultivated prince, lover of<br>the arts, and by all accounts a good violinist. Vitali was a virtuoso on the<br> violone a large bass violin, and proficient on the new cello. Vitali started<br>a musical dynasty at the court that lasted for 4 generations. The Op.11 sonatas are composed for 6 instruments, although the court band had grown to 13 players during Vitali s time there. For this recording, the parts have been doubled, to provide additional continuo. These works were a considerable success for the composer and were consistently in print long after Vitali s death. The music is a sophisticated blend of Italian and French styles, with the dance never far from the composer s mind. They are fascinating works from a skillful composer who was a contemporary of Purcell, Marais, Pachelbel and Corelli. These recordings were made in 2008 and use period instruments from<br>the Italian Renaissance and Baroque eras.']"

The collaboration between Bingham and Burnett developed into a solid artistic relationship during the Crazy Heart recordings, and as a result, Burnett signed on to produce Junky Star. All 12 songs on Junky Star were written by Bingham and performed by his longtime band The Dead Horses, featuring Matt Smith (drums), Elijah Ford (bass) and Corby Shaub (guitar/mandolin).

But when pianist Eden Brent traveled from her hometown to record 'Ain't Got No Troubles,' she eschewed the interstate for meandering country highways that parallel the Mississippi River's route. The circuitous road trip ended at New Orleans' Piety Street, where she recorded with producer Colin Linden in a quest to further broaden her sound: working with bassist George Porter, Jr., she and Linden injected her gritty, rootsy music with spicy elements that earmark the unmistakable Crescent City sound. Brent penned eight of the album's twelve tracks, exhibiting a keen sense of clever wordplay - the juke joint jumper &#34;In Love With Your Wallet&#34; is filled with wry observation, while the vaudeville throwback &#34;My Man&#34; is peppered with double entendre.

Bringing unity to the African continent has been his priority for a long time; the key (along with love, opinions and a great festive sense) lay in the professional practise of music for some thirty-seven years. Yet his career was bound to lead to a form of musical expression that has become universal: Reggae, which was born in Jamaica in the Sixties. <P>As a man of the media and a fighter for citizens\' rights - from wiping out the African debt to the battle against malaria - Youssou N\'Dour is well aware of the political import of reggae, the music-genre directly linked to Rastafarianism, whose leading figure was the ""Ras Tafari"" Haile Selassie, the black Emperor of Ethiopia. <P>As a religion, intellectual movement and way of life, Rastafarianism was conceived some thirty years before the first sound-systems by two Jamaican renegades living in The United States, Marcus Garvey, the ideologist of beauty and black rebellion, and preacher Leonard Percival Howell, who left Jamaica on a ship to America but returned from Harlem to work the soil in the hills of the Caribbean. <P>""From Brazil to Australia and even in Bombay / Africans, Indians and the Portuguese / they love the one-drop in the roots of reggae..."" sings Youssou N\'Dour today. And in Marley Demna, a tribute to Bob Marley, he goes on, ""In the market, his music played all day. Marley was a young man who floated away. He showed the world the route of reggae / One love, No woman no cry."" Youssou N\'Dour shows his allegiance to the genre without pretending to belong; his approach is different from that of African reggae\'s creators, Alpha Blondy from the Ivory Coast, the South African Lucky Dube, who was shot to death in 2007, or followers such as Tiken Jah Fakoli, who took refuge in Mali in 2003 to escape the violence of the civil war raging in the Ivory Coast. What they created, diving deep into their roots, was a radical political movement. <P>Youssou, on the other hand, brushed the wings of reggae with his fingertips. He did so notably in 2000, with the album Joko from Village to Town, which featured an appearance by the Fugee Wyclef Jean, an Afro-American of Haitian origin. But African unity wasn\'t the only thing in the mind of Youssou N\'Dour: he also had the desire to untangle the threads of the black Diaspora. In 1992 he found an ally in filmmaker Spike Lee, who released the album Eyes Open on his label \'40 Acres and A Mule\' (named after the compensation awarded to freed slaves after the American Civil War). At the time Youssou wore a ""wooy wooy"", the woolly hat taken from a song dedicated to the children of Africa quickly branded with an \'X\', as in Malcom X, (but also an \'X\' as in Xippi, his recording-studio in Dakar.) In 2007, in Amazing Grace, the film made by British director Michael Apted, Youssou played out the tragedy of the Negro slave trade in his role as the slave-poet Olaudah Equiano. <P>When ""You"" gives a concert, everything jumps; he brings entire stadiums to their feet. This is Dakar by night, Dakar the capital of pulsating rhythms. Mbalax, the rhythm of the Wolofs, the ethnic majority, is an art-form like a whirling fan (with the dancer\'s fanny replacing the fan.) It\'s also an emotional dance, one of trance, and this is how the story of young Youssou, the kid with the golden voice, began. He was born one October in 1959, the son of a labourer named Elimane and his wife Ndye Sokhna Mboup, a traditional ""Griot"" singer. After two years in street-theatre, Youssou\'s career really started when he was thirteen, and it was the result of a miracle: in 1972, Papa Semba Diop, known as Mba, passed away. He was the leader of the Star Band in Dakar, and Youssou sang a tribute to him, a song he composed onstage right there in Senegal\'s Saint-Louis Stadium. ""Everyone was still in tears, and I brought a little joy. I was vibrating. Mba was like a star fading from the sky."" At the end of his song, Youssou was given a standing ovation. <P>The kid used to go down to the beach at Soumbdioune in Dakar, collecting the little sucker-fish known as takgaal and roasting them on the spot. In the small hours of the morning, he could smell the ovens cooking pastries in the Medina, and in his mind he could already see himself onstage: his career was on the move. In 1990 came one of his most beautiful albums, Set, which included the song Medina, an elegy that was pure and filled with nostalgia, and it featured a clear trumpet whose sound was almost Middle-Eastern. Every day he heard the muezzin\'s calls to prayer, and some nights he could hear the voice of the Egyptian idol Oum Kalsoum. <P>In 2003 he celebrated his becoming a Murid, following the spiritual path of Sufism, with the album Egypt, recorded in Cairo with an Egyptian orchestra conducted by Fati Salama. Two years later in 2005, this hymn to a tolerant Islam received a Grammy Award in America despite the conflict in Iraq. The title Shukran Bamba gave fervent thanks to Sheik Amadou Bamba, the founder of the Murid brotherhood: ""You taught me pardon and compassion, and the rejection of violence and arrogance."" Reggae words, man. <P>In 1981, after leaving the Etoiles group in Dakar, Youssou founded the exemplary orchestra Super Etoile. The sound of the Middle East didn\'t corrupt the Super Etoile any more than the Jamaican musicians hired for the recording of XXXXX. With electric guitar, bass, balafon, teeming percussion, tama (armpit-drum) or djembe, nothing was left to risk. Super Etoile, with all its human variables, was uniquely solid: 1984 saw its Parisian debuts during Africa Fte, the African cultural festival set up by Mamadou Kont from Mali, and it featured in the great pan-African dances and events organised at the Bercy Omnisports stadium in Paris by its leader. <P>After meeting Peter Gabriel in 1984, Youssou N\'Dour joined ""Band Aid for Ethiopia""; in 1988 he sang at Wembley when Nelson Mandela was freed, and then alongside Sting, Tracy Chapman and Bruce Springsteen for Amnesty International. Himself an intensely loyal man, Youssou N\'Dour also provoked fidelity: Sting joined Joko for one title, Don\'t Walk Away, a nonchalant pop tune with lyrics written by Yussuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens). The star from Dakar chose its rhythms and worked on its one drop material for the present album. <P>There are new things here, and compositions written for the circumstance (a magnificent Black Woman, syncopated and swaying), not to mention new readings of past hits like the old Pitche Me, taken from Immigrs (1986), produced with the assistance of Tyron Downie. This huge figure started in music in 1969 at thirteen with Bob Marley, playing with The Wailers during the master\'s time, and then with Peter Tosh or Sly & Robbie before settling in France to keep watch over the sounds of Tonton David and Tiken Jah Fakoly. <P>Youssou N\'Dour could have fallen into the trap of a flat tribute to the federating hero Bob Marley, but instead he chose to take a look at himself in the reggae mirror: when he founded his club, he called it the Thiossane, a word that means ""Our history, reality, that of the lineage which the griots knew and told stories about. My mother and my grandmother were Griots, Toucouleurs people from West Africa. The Griots are there for circumcisions, christenings and wedding feats... they arrange the way the celebrations are organised... But in everyday life they invite themselves to people\'s houses, and spend the day telling stories, humming tales from the countryside about our ancestors, and they accompany themselves on the khalam, a four-string guitar. You can recognise the Griots because every part of their body talks: eyes, hands, even their behinds..."" <P>By 1996 he was already famous worldwide thanks to 7 Seconds, his duet with Neneh Cherry (released in 1994 on the album Wommat, which also featured his cover of Bob Dylan\'s Chimes of Freedom), and he recorded Voices of the Heart of Africa with the great Yand Codou Sne in the pure Senegalese Griot tradition. Still loyal, in 2007 he released Rokku Mi Rokka (the title is in the Pulaar language of the Toucouleurs) with musicians from the north, on the borders of Mauritania and the Sahel states of Mali. From that album\'s traditional return, the new convert to the rhythms of Kingston has chosen Bobolene here. <P>Nothing\'s In Vain, another call for unity, dates from 2002, and it included both Joker, here picked up by vocalist Patrice, and Africa Dream Again, which features Nigerian singer Ayo. With brass, percussion, bass and guitar lines all from Jamaican sources - the album was recorded in the spring of 2009 at Kingston\'s Tuff Gong studios with Dean Fraser on saxophone, Michael Fletcher on ""dancehall"" bass and Earl ""Chinna"" Smith on guitar - the album\'s instrumental add-ons are all wedded to Africa\'s memory and modernity, and its leitmotif is Youssou N\'Dour: from Bombay to Rio, and from Dakar to Melbourne, via New York and Bamako.

Originally released in 1959, Chega de Saudade is the album cited as creating bossa nova so to say that it lit a fire in the music world would be putting it mildly. It would be perhaps more accurate to say that it influenced so many musicians both at home (Caetano Veloso, Jorge Ben, etc.) and abroad (Stan Getz, Herbie Mann, Charlie Byrd) that it effectively single-handedly changed the way people both made and listened to music, and put Brazilian artists on the map.

The Pirates of Penzance is a high-spirited romp that irresistibly parodies the dramatic and musical gestures of Italian grand opera. The Gondoliers is a work of irresistibly sunny exuberance. Though set in Venice, the operetta satirizes both the snobbery and growing republicanism of 1880s Britain. Gilbert and Sullivan's greatest success, The Mikado, exploited the craze for Japanese culture that had been sweeping London in the years before its premiere in 1885.

It seemed so pure, and at the same time, wild and improbable. <P>Who could imagine this, that an artist whose link to the modern world of commercial pop music was appearing on records by Lupe Fiasco, who was still in her early 20s and had no solo recordings on her resume, would reach out to songwriters such as Jimmy Webb, Carole King, Lamont Dozier, Burt Bacharach, Bob Dylan, and ask them to collaborate, and that so many of them would open their doors? That she could spend weeks in Nashville writing with members of the Country Music Songwriters Hall of Fame like Bobby Braddock, go to Martha's Vineyard to write with Carly Simon, recapture the sound of Philly Soul with Thom Bell? Get Brill Building writers Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil and Jeff Barry, all now relocated in Los Angeles, to write with her the way they used to write in the cubicles of Aldon Music? It was hard not to get swept up in her enthusiasm, and at the same time, wondering if she'd be able to pull this off. <P>That was around three years ago, when Nikki and her producer Sam Hollander started talking about the project that is now called `Pennies In A Jar.' Nikki had told Sam that what she had in mind, at first, was a modern version of Carole King's `Tapestry': an album rich in melody, emotional and truthful, with all the songwriting elements that are in such short supply, even on pop radio, where songs sound assembled out of spare parts that are lying around in the studio, a beat here, a riff there, a lyric idea from somewhere else. Nikki wanted to get back. Sam thought about this, and expanded on it. Why doesn't she, if she wants to capture that essence of songwriting, work with some of the form's masters, the architects? Go to the source. <P>So they began this. With the help of publishers Jody Gerson and Marty Bandier, and a contract with a major label, they started to contact a wish list of people to write with. Jimmy Webb, who almost never collaborates, said he would. Burt Bacharach sent Nikki melodies for verses and chorus, and waited for a lyric before sending her the bridge: he wanted to be sure. Mann & Weil welcomed her into their home. Dylan sent her an unfinished song from the `Shot of Love' era, and invited her to complete it. She got to write with Luigi Creatore, whose roots go back to the `50s with Sam Cooke, and who wrote for Elvis. <P>Ultimately, maybe fifty songs were written for this album. What you hear is a compact history of pop: the girl group sound, Motown, the sophisticated melodies of Bacharach and Webb, a place where country literally meets hip-hop, the art of the singer-songwriter. All tied together by Nikki Jean's warmth, her joy in making this music, her gift to be able to change shape and still stay herself. The challenge for her, and for Sam, was to take all these influences, all this geographical and musical range, and make it flow. To point, in each individual track, to the place it sprang from, and have it fit with the songs surrounding it. To sound, always, like Nikki. They've accomplished this beautifully, and anybody who cares about real songs, and who loves discovering something new, and who is dazzled by the names on the songwriting credits alongside Nikki's, needs to listen.""]"

Country music seems to be an increasingly neutered genre, where nothing at all is said, where a hit song that welcomes a world where a black man could become president was seen as a bridge too far by some. Contrast that discomfort with the bravery of an artist like Merle Haggard producing a song like Irma Jackson in the late 1960s. That The Hag is name-checked by so many current country stars as an influence is ironic, given that the bravery exhibited in this one song is greater than the combined bravery of every artist currently on the country chart.<br><br>Into this tepid landscape, Jason Boland releases his latest album, Rancho Alto. Even though its songs are not likely to be topping the country charts anytime soon, Jason is adamant that this is country music. It may fit in with some other types of music, like Americana maybe, but I m not ready to give up on the idea that country music can be relevant, says Jason. And country music is what I play. My fans are George Strait fans. They go to the dancehalls to see shows. I know these people. They are more capable of complex thought than the country music industry thinks they are. <br><br>Many of the characters that populate Rancho Alto are struggling and reacting to their travails. At heart, this album is about embracing the truths that country music used to tell, but that it can seemingly no longer stomach telling. It used to be that a country artist would sing about the farmer that lost his land; now they glorify the party at the lake. For those of you who love country music, but hate what it's become, Jason Boland will sing you back home.""]"

Spotlighted by VH1 as a band ""You Oughta Know,"" the group toured endlessly, playing over 200 shows and selling more than 500,000 singles along the way. They\'re raising the stakes with THESE TIMES (Universal Republic), a scintillating hookfest of arena-ready rock anthems, offering unequivocal proof that the group has the goods to break wide open. Working with producers Howard Benson, Espionage (the New York-based Norwegian team of Espen Lind and Amund Bjrklund) and OneRepublic\'s Ryan Tedder, these four skilled and remarkably self-assured musicians have cooked up a strikingly melodic, sharply drawn, viscerally immediate album filled with songs that stick in the head and heart. For a young band, SafetySuit--singer/guitarist Doug Brown, drummer Tate Cunningham, bassist Jeremy Henshaw and guitarist Dave Garofolo--has a remarkable sense of songwriter savvy. ""I do the writing,"" Brown confirms, ""but until we get Dave, Jeremy and Tate\'s heads around the songs, they\'re just songs, they\'re not SafetySuit songs. When they get hold of them, they become ours, and that\'s what makes us special--the four of us, not just one guy."" After cutting a half an album\'s worth of material in Nashville last spring, the band had a shocking collective realization--neither the song nor the performances, they concluded, met their lofty standards. ""We\'d been going nonstop for three years, and were burned out,"" says Brown. ""We just had to get away from it for a little bit, live life and gain some perspective. So we actually threw away the hard drives containing the tracks we\'d done and started all over again."" It didn\'t take long for something fresh to manifest itself. Brown headed to New York to toss around ideas with the guys from Espionage, who were riding high after co-writing and producing Train\'s massive hit, ""Hey Soul Sister."" ""They played me a really interesting chord progression,"" Doug recalls, ""and I started spontaneously singing along with it, [sings] /Take me back to yesterday/I swear it on your life.\' They saw that I was in a zone, and they said, `Go into this room and just be by yourself for a while.\' A half hour later, I came out and said, `What if we came around at the end and went [sings], `We can get around this, get around this\'?"" They were like, `OK, let\'s start recording.\' It was really that quick. If you catch an emotional moment in the writing process, one sentence, one word, can fire off an entire song in a matter of minutes. The best songs practically write themselves. It\'s all about tapping into a feeling and letting those emotions take over."" That song, ""Get Around This,"" set the bar sky-high for Brown and his bandmates, and in the following months they challenged themselves to hit consistently on the rarefied level Brown and Espionage had established. Brown went straight from New York to Bahrain to play some military shows with the band around the Fourth of July holiday last year, During that trip, totally out of his element, he wrote a slew of songs, several of which wound up on the album. <P>In September, he got together with a talented friend, OneRepublic\'s Ryan Tedder, in the latter\'s Colorado studio, which yielded the album\'s lead single, ""Let Go."" ""I love that song,"" says Doug, ""because it\'s such a departure for us. Ryan is obviously a very pop-minded producer, so I said, `Let\'s have fun with it; let\'s do something that\'s not the norm.\' It turned out great, and it kills live. It\'s very interactive and people get it right away."" A second get-together with Espionage resulted in ""Things to Say,"" while the band self-produced ""Staring at It,"" a fist-pumper with an incendiary chorus, and ""Life in the Pain."" They cut five songs with Benson in L.A. this March: ""Never Stop,"" ""One Time,"" ""Believe,"" ""Stranger (Say It)"" and the poignant ""These Times,"" which functions as the album\'s thematic centerpiece. ""It was written out of a social need,"" Brown says of this powerful, zeitgeist-capturing anthem. ""As a band, we were talking a lot about the songs on the record, and obviously, a lot of songs are gonna be about relationships, love and loss; that\'s the most common emotion people have. But as we were looking at the track, we felt like something was missing: what the pulse of the nation is right now. When we started thinking and talking about that, `These Times\' sprang out of that. The chorus goes, `Sitting alone here in my bed/Waiting for an answer I don\'t know that I\'ll get/I cannot stand to look in the mirror I\'m failing.\' You just get tired of being on the short end of the stick; I think a lot of people feel that way. There\'s a lot of people out there who would kill to just have a job so they can provide for their families. It\'s tough, man--it\'s tough for people, and that sucks. But we didn\'t want to leave it at that, so we wrote, `These times are hard/But they will pass,\' and that\'s important to remind people of. We\'ve made it out of bad times before, and we\'ll make it out again."" At the other extreme is the intensely personal ""Never Stop,"" an unguarded expression of romantic devotion. ""The best songs ride the line between vulnerability and too much information, where you take it to the maximum amount of vulnerability before you start weirding people out,"" Brown asserts, punctuating the statement with a laugh. ""I think `Never Stop\' does that, and I think any woman who\'s with someone they love wants to hear him say, `I\'m never gonna get used to you.\'"" Despite the fact that the band interacted with three producers, each possessing a particular approach, the album comes across as a thoroughly unified piece of work. ""What I loved about all of them is that they were all like, `Where do you want to take it and how can we help you to get there?\'"" Brown says of Benson, Espionage and Tedder. ""But you\'ve gotta go into it knowing where you want it to go in the first place."" This hard-hitting yet life-embracing album strikingly displays SafetySuit\'s singular sound and style as well as the clarity of the band\'s vision. That vision was sufficiently present on the first album and the hundreds of performances that followed it to bring them a loyal, enthusiastic fanbase--one that is about to undergo exponential growth. SafetySuit is an extremely confident, distinctly American unit right on the brink of establishing itself as a band that matters.']"

The move established Mann as the leading exponent of jazz played with African percussion instruments added to the rhythm section, a position underlined by his passionate playing and consistent musical perception on these two albums. Although vibraphonist Johnny Rae is exhilarating throughout both, at the music s core remains the wonderfully exciting rhythmic interplay between the congas, bongos and drums.

Flos Campi was completed in 1925 and despite the prominent solo viola and wordless chorus, it is neither a concerto nor a choral work. The seamless viola line moves in unity with the orchestra and the chorus appears as a body of instruments, creating an effect of mesmerizing beauty and calm. The little-performed Suite for viola and small orchestra was written ten years later and contains some of the composer's most lyrical themes.

B005OKEWEQ,A5R336VHUTPQR,1,1353283200,War to Head,Ape Machine,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Pop']","['War To Head is the sophomore release by Ape Machine. Recorded at The Magic Closet Studios with Isaiah ""Ikey"" Owens (Mastodon, The Mars Volta, TV on the Radio) and mixed at Supernatural Sound (The Thermals, Bright Eyes, Modest Mouse), the album delivers nine tracks of heavy, organic music that melds exhilarating ambitiousness with a well-honed accessibility.', 'Better-known for its indie bands, Portland, Ore., also possesses a powerful hard-rock and metal scene. (See Toxic Holocaust, Across the Sun, etc.) PDX quartet Ape Machine, as its name suggests (adding a ""T"" gives you ""tape machine,"" a nod to heavy music\'s analog origins), offers organic, bong-worthy bliss for those of us who don\'t own enough Black Sabbath and Rainbow ""background"" records with which to smoke epic bowls. <P>Bluesy, boozy and darkly psychedelic, the band\'s sophomore effort, War to Head, holds eight shaggy, head-banging originals, plus--you guessed it--a rollickin\' Deep Purple cover (""Black Night""). It all charges ahead in straightforward fashion, much like your cousin\'s old 1971 AMC Javelin--except for wicked, slow-burning blues number ""No Sugar in My Coffee."" <P>Singer Caleb Heinze wields the perfect frontman voice, smoky and haunted, even if his nebulous and mystical lyrics seem calculatingly retro. Guitarist Ian Watts has an appropriate last name given the tower of amplifiers he must employ to project such a killer tone. In addition, bassist Brian True and drummer Monte Fuller maintain a crushing momentum. Check out ""Downtrodden,"" which lumbers forward like a drunken Sasquatch lost in the woods near Robert Johnson\'s juke joint. <P>I never thought I\'d find a stoner-rock group that will appeal to fans of The Sword and Whitesnake, but here it is. No seeds or stems, either. -- <i>Tucson Weekly, September 29, 2011</i><br /><br />Contrary to the metal scene that\'s sprung up around them in Portland, Oregon, Ape Machine prefer to -- ahem -- ape the psychedelic blues of the 70s when delivering their heavy brand of smoke n\' roll. Their debut, This House Has Been Condemned, was full of slow burning, seven minute jams over top of which vocalist Caleb Heinze howled at the moon, and kind of reminded me of a laid back Zen Guerrilla, man. Well, not ones to rest on their cosmic laurels, Ape Machine have embraced the more metal aspects of the 70s hard rock sound on their latest album, War to Head, which means the riffs are mightier and the dynamics are retro-fried, giving `em a tighter, bolder, Deep Purple push with some fuzzy Gothenburg gusto thrown in for good measure. They still manage to find occasion to slip into their former ways however, as evidenced by the quick shot of soul that is ""No Sugar in My Coffee,"" the groove and noodling of ""What\'s Up Stanley?"" and the electric slide throughout ""The Sun,"" ""Downtrodden,"" and ""Please Do Not Use Red Ink and Do Not Erase,"" but it\'s songs like ""Hold Your Tongue,"" ""Can\'t Cure Deceit,"" ""Death of the Captain,"" and ""Black Night"" that flex a wicked Sabbath muscle and propel Ape Machine into the stoner realm on the wings of bell bottoms and dirty blues. -- <i>BrokenBeard.com, October 27, 2011</i><br /><br />Hey kids. I\'ve been thinking a lot about you lately because I feel bad most of you have never had the experience of inheriting a collection of vinyl and spending all night spinning records in near dark while wearing Koss Pro headphones. I had one of those turntables where I could stack about ten records and they would play one right after the other. I still miss the sound of the next record dropping. The music, all-consuming, warm, and fantastic, trapped my imagination as I studied the lyrics and photos on the record sleeves. <P>The closest thing you can get to that right now is Ape Machine. My review copy of their sophomore release War To Head is only missing the ticks and pops from genuine vinyl to actually transport me through time back to 1976. This album took me back to the original impact of hard rock and why I fell in love with heavy music to begin with. Fuck yes. <P>To really appreciate Ape Machine, you have to also listen to their debut, This House Has Been Condemned because War To Head is a progression of their experimentation with sounds from the 70s. You see, kids, the metal you enjoy today would not have been possible without a little movement in the late 60s that started in England where American-style blues was given new life. Blues Incorporated was a band with a turnstile line-up that included members of the Rolling Stones, Cream, and other guitar-heavy bands of the late 60s and early 70s. The blues scene in London massively changed rock as it was known. Jimi Hendrix always desired to return to his own blues roots and found himself there along side Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Alvin Lee, and many other guitar greats. If you are into those folks, then Ape Machine\'s debut will sound like an old friend. <P>War To Head picks up where This House Has Been Condemned stopped. Right out of the gates, the opener, ""Hold Your Tongue"", is like getting a fist full of early Black Sabbath with Tony Iommi riffing the helm. Even Ape Machine\'s Caleb Heinze sounds like he\'s channeling pre-unlikeable Ozzy. While Ape Machine\'s first album was more bluesy and sounded as if it was produced by Hendrix himself, War To Head is a tour through the sounds that started metal, also called acid rock. Aside from Sabbath, you can hear echoes of metal\'s forefathers. ""The Sun"" has a Deep Purple feel to it as a powerful progressive rocker with amazing drums and bass thanks to Brian True and Monte Fuller. It\'s also my favorite track from the whole album with its psychedelic lyrics and pure energy. <P>While I enjoy Ape Machine\'s contemporaries like The Sword, Spiral Arms, Sweet Cobra, Monster Magnet and other so-called ""stoner"" bands, I find it hard to directly compare them. Songs like ""Can\'t Cure Deceit"", ""Death of the Captain"", and ""Please Do Not Use Red Ink and Do Erase"" sound like deep cuts only Clyde Clifford would play on Beaker Street. Clifford called this stuff acid rock and helped the make the term famous. Clifford would play tracks by bands like Bad Company, Foghat, Savoy Brown, and Blue Oyster Cult, but he wouldn\'t play the hits; he played their jam session tracks and B-sides. Plus he gave air time to The Fairport Convention, Iron Butterfly, and many other bands who you can hear Ape Machine\'s Ian Watts lovingly dovetail into his riffs. <P>The quartet include lots of 70s style organ. You can really hear it in ""Black Night,"" where Deep Purple seems like an even more apt comparison. I also dig ""What\'s Up Stanley?"" which has such a fun funky vibe it reminded me of the first time I listened to Physical Graffiti; for a track that\'s only three and a half minutes, it packs wallop. <P>Now Ape Machine isn\'t totally stuck in the 1970s. According to their press kit they do record everything old-school analog, which I think does their style justice. Even their name is a reference to open reel recordings. However, they don\'t go off into 20 minute drug-induced tracks of nonsense. Their song writing style is modern and accessible for today\'s surly youths (that\'s you). If I had to classify the band as anything, I would just call them genius. Ape Machine know their acid rock and are not afraid to use it. <P>War To Head is like an album of nothing but deep cuts that were meant to wear out your tapes and records. I cannot give the album or Ape Machine higher praise. If there was a way to wear out an MP3 file into nothing, I would have done it already. Buy this album, put on some headphones, sit in the dark, and then lose yourself in one of the best albums of the year. -- <i>TheNewReview.net, September 12, 2011 </i>']"

The Limited Edition was fully subscribed before manufacture, and that in less than two months, 11,000 sets have already been sold over the counter, with thousands more ordered by dealers. The success of Chailly\'s interpretation has found its echo in the UK press\' acclaim for the performances Chailly and the Gewandhaus gave during their Beethoven tour in autumn 2011: ""an ideal synthesis of Italian passion and German precision"" (The Times), ""an exhilarating adventure"" (Sunday Times) and a ""conductor who genuinely deserves to be called great"" (Guardian). In Italy, the 5-CD album has made history by entering the pop charts and went to no.1 in the UK Classical Chart. Based on a series of enthusiastically-acclaimed Leipzig concerts, the Cycle was recorded over a period of three years, and is generously accompanied by no less than eight of the composer\'s overtures - now available on five individual releases as well. The Cycle brilliantly demonstrates the revitalisation that Chailly has brought to this, the oldest of German orchestras. From the Haydnesque elegance of the first two symphonies, through the dramatic power of the Fifth, to the grandeur and drama of the Ninth, the orchestra\'s unique combination of unfailing finesse and renewed fire characterize all these exhilarating performances. Deutschland Radio Kultur predicted: ""For this flawlessly recorded new Beethoven cycle, it\'s highly likely that Chailly will be adding new prizes to his already long list of recording awards.""

But that\'s not all: the set also includes a disc of 24 ""Lost & Found"" Marvelettes tracks from the Motown vaults, featuring never-before-heard songs written and produced by Smokey Robinson, Norman Whitfield, Mickey Stevenson, Johnny Bristol and more. These ""vault gems"" are from the group\'s entire career, 1961-70, and each one begs the question: ""How come this didn\'t come out?"" Other rarities: an unreleased, extended mix of ""When You\'re Young And In Love,"" with a spoken intro; the long Anthology LP version of ""The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game;"" a U.K.-only version of the LP track ""I\'m Gonna Hold On Long As I Can,"" with an extended intro; and various vault tracks, like ""Love Is Good"" and ""Poor Little Rich Girl,"" found on U.K. CD releases in recent years.

Above driving guitar lines McCartney asks, ''Are you receiving what you're believing / Are you sure just what you are,'' in the EP's opening track, <i>I Only Want To Be Alone</i>. The powerful vulnerability of <i>Wings Of A Lightest Weight</i> is the expression of a son's feelings of love for his mother (''Watching you fly away / Whilst your wings of a lightest weight / Carry you back through the heat of the wind / Carry you back to me''). 12-string-guitar arpeggios reminiscent of <i>Glisten</i> from <b>Available Light</b> return for the uplifting song <i>The Sound Of My Voice</i>. The playfully esoteric <i>Else And Else But Dead</i> is followed by an emotional tour de force, <i>Jesus Be My Friend</i>, where McCartney plumbs the depths of his own convictions (''Boulder in a stream / Water on a stone / God is close at hand / You never understood / Just who I really was / Just who I really am''). <i>Fallen Angel</i> provides a hopeful dawn after this dark night of the soul."", ""''Some artists are happy doing the same thing again and again, but my favorite artists are the ones who evolve and grow, and I want to be one of them,'' says James.

Music reconstruction and preparation by John Morgan, Anna Bonn and William Stromberg.\n\nThe Tribute Film Classics team delivers a knockout recording of a great Bernard Herrmann find, the complete score for the 1969 WWII drama, Battle of Neretva. Written for full orchestra with expanded brass and percussion sections, the score mirrors the tone of the story, and features suspenseful moments of subdued tension, bittersweet string interludes, trudging music of despair for the displaced evacuees, but most of all, incredibly powerful, exciting, and relentless battle music and marches.\n\nThe score as heard in the film was, for the most part, butchered. Almost none of the cues are heard in their entirety, and some were dropped altogether. Although an original soundtrack CD was issued on the Southern Cross label, it contained only about thirty minutes of the score. This new Tribute recording doubles that amount, and presents the complete versions of all the music heard in the film, plus several unused cues, all in exceptionally well-recorded, thrillingly detailed sound. For those who have only heard the old CD, and especially those who have only seen the severely edited movie, this new recording will be a revelation. Astute listeners will notice that Herrmann revisited a few of his earlier works, reworking a few cues from previous scores, most notably On Dangerous Ground (including the famous Death Hunt, which receives a riveting, adrenaline-filled performance here).\n\nAlso included are highlights of Herrmanns score for another WWII film, The Naked and the Dead (1958), featuring a pounding, determined main title march that is a showcase for the massed brasses and percussion. Other portions alternate between slower atmospheric pieces for the soldiers treks through the jungle, and piercing, angry cues when they engage the enemy.']"

I was listening to a lot of early Buddy Holly, Ricky Nelson, and the Everly Brothers, and the mood struck me one day to sit down and put to tape some songs that felt graceful and uncomplicated. Simplicity was what I wanted, musically and lyrically. During the winter months, simpler fare sticks to the ribs, but hopefully it tastes just as good.''<br><br><br>Bringing In the Darlings was recorded and mixed in four days at Homeward Sound Studios in Ritter's current hometown of Brooklyn, New York.""]"

The Second Symphony was written to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik October Revolution. Its advanced idiom of experimental textures and abstract effects can perhaps be best described as organised musical chaos. The Fifteenth was Shostakovich's last symphony and is filled with remarkable contrasts, from the rollicking quotes from Rossini's William Tell Overture and eerie references to Wagner's G+tterd+mmerung and Tristan und Isolde, to the last and perhaps most imaginative of the composer's symphonic passacaglias. Vasily Petrenko became Chief Conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra in September 2009, and in 2013 will become Chief Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra. He was the Classical BRIT Awards Male Artist of the Year 2010 and the Classic FM/Gramophone Young Artist of the Year 2007. In 2009 he was awarded Honorary Doctorates by the University of Liverpool and Liverpool Hope University."", ""The seventh entry in Vasily Petrenko's outstanding sequence of<br>Shostakovich symphonies pairs two works that stand at opposing poles<br>of Shostakovic's creative life but present similar interpretive<br>puzzles. The Second Symphony, written to commemorate the 10th<br>anniversary of the October Revolution, begins with music as<br>modernistic as anything Shostakovich ever wrote but ends in a<br>bombastic choral setting of Leninist agitprop poetry. The Fifteenth<br>Symphony, the composer's last, swerves from an almost giddy sense of play to death-haunted musings to a bleak serenity; along the way<br>Shostakovich mixes in enigmatic allusions to Rossini and Wagner. In<br>both pieces, esteem for the music sits alongside bafflement at what<br>these pieces mean, and what they say about the composer's elusive<br>inner life.<br> <br>The performances contain no such enigmas. Petrenko, who conducted the Boston Symphony in a terrific performance of the Shostakovich Tenth in 2009, and the Liverpool orchestra give accounts of both works that teem with energy and fresh insights. Petrenko is especially good at reconciling the two sides of the Second Symphony, making as convincing a case as can be made for it. In the Fifteenth he takes the childhood innocence out of the first movement and instead makes it sound brooding and sinister it's a dark but deeply compelling vision of<br>the piece. The orchestra's lower brass are especially impressive. This<br>cycle is shaping up to be one of the best in recent memory. --Boston Globe, David Weininger""]"

Works premiered in that year included sonatas and concertos composed by the great Alessandro Scarlatti and a host of works by his talented contemporaries and successors. On this recording, recorder virtuoso Maurice Steger brings a selection of these musical treasures back to life, drawing on a Neapolitan manuscript collection dating from 1725.

The words cite the legend of a destructive princess, and tell the government it should be nurturing the people, not destroying them, their environment and their culture. Erora, which follows, expands on this idea. Literally, the word means take it easy, and here Taiwo and Kehinde use it as an exhortation to the governing and industrial elite. Take it easy, they sing: if you use money or power in a negative way, you will destroy the world. By 1979, the oil-driven ecological rape of the Nigerian delta was already woefully advanced. The general ambiance is similar to the apala/fuji/waka mix of Bayi L ense on Mother Africa. <br><br> Gbowo Mi, a song to Oshun, the river goddess, is pure balm for the soul, with a delightful acoustic piano vamp.

Working from the instrumental source material, Mathieu brings us a new experience of the most stirring textures and darkest thoughts from this pivotal album.<br><br>Mathieu first collaborated with Sylvian at 2011 s Punkt festival in Kristiansand, Norway, when he performed a live remix of Sylvian s ambient classic Plight and Premonition. Sylvian recently began work on an iOS application to display a collection of his digital photography. He invited Mathieu to develop an ambient score for the application, using material from 2003 s Blemish.<br><br>'I ve lived with Stephan s work for many years,' says Sylvian. 'After hearing his remix at Punkt I decided he d be the right person to ask to rework the Blemish material. I d originally planned on doing it myself but once Stephan had planted his signature ambience in my mind it seemed the better option to have him take a look at the files. The recordings have a beautiful clarity about them due to their simple but sturdy frameworks, and their open ended architecture makes them ideal for a project of this sort.' When Mathieu first heard Blemish, 'I was quite amazed by the album, its dark beauty ... . When David sent me the files from the sessions one year ago, they were a pool of wonderful material to me, detached from the songs and original album, while very much connected to David at the same time.'<br><br>A startling break from Sylvian s previous work, Blemish is pensive and spare, wrapping a lyrical raw nerve in extended, drone like song structures. Recorded in a relatively quick six week burst, Blemish was 'cathartic' for Sylvian. An earlier remix album, 2005 s The Good Son vs. The Only Daughter, took the material in varied and lusher directions, but Wandermde puts it under a microscope. The catharsis of the original is tested and reinvigorated by Mathieu s treatment, which he performs in real time.<br><br>'My work with computers is always live,' Mathieu explains. 'I m feeding selected material into a software process and record the output, which I either take as is, or discard completely. I don t multi track, edit or re arrange, I m interested in self evolving sound with all its rough and sometimes faulty qualities. I never use effects like artificial reverb in my music, so what you hear is rather a piling up of spaces that surround the individual inputs used for my processes.'<br><br>'With David s recordings I melted them with my instruments, recorded several takes and picked the best ones. While I first processed the recordings quite heavily, it took me a while to notice that I come to better results when David s performance shines through much more clearly. For instance with the original guitar from Blemish, I only applied a soft processing and made a room recording of playing this version back through two Fender Twin amps.'<br><br>A guest from Blemish also makes a return appearance on this album.

It hadn't been an easy decade for Maybelle, but little about her life resembled a cakewalk. She'd waged a long struggle with heroin addiction and suered from diabetes. But those physical maladies failed to silence her fabulous pipes. You could always tell it was Maybelle singing, four bars or less into any of her classic platters. She had a curious burr in her voice and a touching vulnerability. It was particularly acute on the smoky after-hours blues ballads that were her specialty from the early 1950s on. Maybelle could rock the house, make no mistake; she cut &#34;Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On&#34; long before a cocky young piano pounder from Ferriday, Louisiana latched onto it and made it his eternal signature theme. But she could absolutely tear your heart out on the slower stuff. The woman clearly knew what pain was all about. Rojac was the last label Maybelle recorded for. In search of that elusive hit that would relaunch her career, Taylor gave her some of the most challenging material she ever tackled, stu miles outside her wheelhouse. That she actually squeaked onto the pop charts in early 1967 with a soulful rendering of ? & the Mysterians garage rock anthem 96 Tears, even as the original was falling o that very same hit parade, was a truly remarkable achievement, testifying to her uncommon resiliency. Big Maybelle ultimately lost her battle with diabetes in 1972 in Cleveland, Ohio. She'd bravely kept on singing until she couldn t anymore. &#34;She was very soulful and very powerful&#34; says Thelma Jones. &#34;...She was one of the best, and one of the great soul singers of our time.&#34; - Bill Dahl from the extensive liner notes""]"

For his humble beginning, however, Motown teamed him with producers and writers Henry Cosby and Clarence Paul, both of whom would feature prominently in Stevies career for the rest of the decade.

Three new sets devoted to Mahler, Bach, Rameau, Handel, Gluck & Haydn and 20th Century Music are coming out this May. Otto Klemperer had a remarkable career as a young man but it was at the age of 70 that he started a series of recordings that would not only establish him as an internationally renowned conductor but provide EMI with a catalogue of recordings that became and remain touchstones.<br><br>At the age of 42, Klemperer became of the Kroll Opera in Berlin and was responsible for numerous premieres of the music by modern composers especially Igor Stravinsky, Paul Hindemith and Kurt Weill. It was a source of pride that he brought so many works by Stravinsky to the public and this continued even when Stravinsky and Klemperer were in America where the Symphony in Three Movements was written. Klemperer was so captivated by the Berthold Brecht-Kurt Weill Die Dreigroschenoper when it opened in Berlin in 1928 that he commissioned the 28year-old composer to make a suite for wind instruments based on the original score. The result was the Kleine Dreigroschenmusik, which was played for the first time at the annual Berlin opera ball under Klemperer s direction.<br><br>Not only a conductor, Klemperer loved to compose and three works were recorded, The first, in October 1961, was Merry Waltz taken from his opera Das Ziel and re-orchestrated for a larger orchestra which had originally premiered in August 1936 in Los Angeles. The second is his Symphony No. 2 which had had a private recording earlier in 1969 but which EMI then decided deserved proper session time and was released to celebrate his 85th birthday. His String Quartet No. 7 was recorded in 1970, with the Philharmonia String Quartet for the same reason.<br><br>The 4-CD box set includes a musical bonus in the Overture and Dream Pantomime from Hnsel und Gretel composed by Engelbert Humperdinck. He had often conducted the opera and his wife, the soprano Johanna Geissler, had alternated the roles of Gretel and the Witch. The set concludes with Jon Tolansky's Sound Biography which illustrates how Otto Klemperer inspired musicians and music lovers not only with his conducting but also with his extraordinary courage, surviving extreme physical and mental adversity with remarkable stoicism. This special disc also includes two never before released items that were discovered as this feature was being prepared: a speech by Dr Klemperer at a reception for his 75th birthday, and a rehearsal during his recording sessions for Mozart's Don Giovanni. An entire hour of rehearsal can be heard on a bonus CD that appears with EMI Classics' reissue of the complete opera.""]"

No matter how primitive the recording techniques may be, the soul makes its way to the heart and mind of the listener. Samtvogel is one of those records. Gnter Schickert recorded this amazing piece of human greatness in 1974, using the media he had at the time, putting his brain to work to find the best way of taping everything he had to say. After three months of work, between June and September 1974, Samtvogel was privately issued that same year. It would later be issued on the Brain label, with a small change in the artwork titles added to the front cover, which weren t on the original private pressing. Brain also reissued it on the label s Rock On Brain LP series, this time with a completely different sleeve. The album contained two tracks on side one and just one on side two, and its sound has often been compared to the most explorative works of Syd Barrett. However, it must be pointed out that Schickert did not need any mind-spreading substances to allow his sounds to float out of his mind and soul; they just came out in the most natural way. It will appeal to fans of the echoed atmospheric guitar work of other Krautrock innovators such as Ash Ra Temple, Manuel Gtsching, or A.R. & The Machines, and some may find on the vocal passages certain resemblances to Damo Suzuki in Can! s Tago Mago era.']"

Ever since Kirill Kondrashin and Bernard Haitink first led performances of Shostakovich's symphonies in the late 1970s, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra has astonished listeners with their level of refinement and involvement in this repertoire. With the tenure of Mariss Jansons, a degree of authenticity is added; like Kondrashin before him, Jansons has experienced himself what it is like to work under Soviet conditions. Following the award winning RCO Live release of his interpretation of Shostakovich's seventh symphony, Jansons's take on the composer's tenth adds another benchmark performance to the orchestra's discography.""]"

As the siege of the city intensified, he worked on his Seventh Symphony, completing three movements before being forced to leave Leningrad and travel east by train. The work was completed in December that year.

Presented here together on one CD, <b>Bobby Whitlock</b> (1972) and <b>Raw Velvet</b> (also 1972) are star-studded (George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Delaney & Bonnie), soulful albums from one of rock music's key unsung figures."", ""Whitlock's story is a remarkable one. Born to a hardscrabble existence, raised in abject poverty, abused by his preacher father and sent out to pick cotton in the fields. Moving from one railroad town to another, Whitlock was quite literally from the wrong side of the tracks. Yet thanks to his singing and piano playing, music was Whitlock's escape. Winding up in Memphis, Whitlock hooked up with Stax Records, who signed him as the first white artist to their new pop label HIP. But it was soul music, not pop, that was in Whitlock's heart - and his break came when Delaney & Bonnie asked him to join their band, The Friends."", ""Following Delaney & Bonnie from Stax to Elektra Records, Whitlock found his life starting to intertwine with '60s rock royalty. Delaney & Bonnie took him on tour with Blind Faith, where Eric Clapton was impressed with Whitlock's playing and the camaraderie he saw in The Friends. Soon, Whitlock joined Clapton, Jim Gordon and Carl Radle in Derek & The Dominos, the crack unit that backed George Harrison on much of the seminal <b>All Things Must Pass</b> and recorded the classic rock album <b>Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs</b>."", ""During the recording of those albums, Whitlock tentatively made his first steps as a solo artist. Though drugs were already beginning to tear Derek & The Dominoes apart, Whitlock was able to call on some high profile friends (and ''Friends'') to play on his album, including Clapton, Harrison, session bassist Klaus Voorman (John Lennon, Carly Simon, et al), drummer Jim Gordon, Chris Wood (of Traffic) and others. ''I really loved my first record and everything that was behind it,'' says Whitlock now. ''And for the love that was brought to the room by everyone each time we recorded. I know that you can hear it in Eric's solo on <i>The Scenery Has Slowly Changed</i>.''"", ""When Bobby presented his album to Atlantic Records they rejected it, citing a different vision for his debut record. So Bobby bought himself out of his contract. Soon after, The Dominos split up following troubled second album sessions. Bobby just kept moving: first back to his rural home in England, then to France, where the Rolling Stones were recording <b>Exile On Main Street</b>. He found a deal for his debut album (via producer Jimmy Miller) and a follow-up too. That second album, <b>Raw Velvet</b>, featured the Edwin Hawkins Singers, the L.A. Symphony, Eric Clapton, Jim Gordon and Bobby's new band members: Rick Vito on guitar, Keith Ellis on bass and Don Poncher on drums. Andy Johns co-produced the self-titled debut (with Whitlock) and Jimmy Miller produced the <b>Raw Velvet</b> LP.

This set of seven CDs, the first truly comprehensive survey of Tudor's work as a composer, goes beyond any previous attempt to document that process of transformation. It captures his touch and sensitivity and offers an expansive, previously unavailable view onto more than three decades of Tudor's astonishingly original work as an electronic musician. It neatly describes the arc of his career, from his first composition, <i>Bandoneon !

Six works that were issued in excerpted form in <i>Music for Merce (1952-2009)</i> are issued here complete. Other highlights include the live soundscapes for the Pepsi Pavilion at the 1970 Osaka World Expo, the marvelous simultaneous performance with John Cage of <i>Mesostics Re Merce Cunningham/Untitled</i>, and two extended binaural recordings of <i>Rainforest IV</i> with Composers Inside Electronics, the best recorded documents of this signature work.

Their spine-tingling three-part harmony singing, mixing Wendell Holmes' gruff and gravelly vocals with Sherman Holmes' rich baritone and Popsy Dixon's soaring falsetto brings the spirit of gospel-inflected deep soul music into every song they perform. Equally gripping is the rhythmic foundation laid down by Sherman's bass playing and Popsy's drumming, perfectly complementing Wendell's blues-soaked guitar solos and church-inspired piano playing. The band expertly blends Saturday night's roadhouse rock and blues with the gospel passion of Sunday morning's church service. Rolling Stone says The Holmes Brothers play ''impressive, fervent country soul.'' Entertainment Weekly goes further, declaring ''The Holmes Brothers are juke joint vets with a brazenly borderless view of American music...timeless and rapturous.''<br><br>The band's new Alligator Records album, BROTHERHOOD, is another stellar chapter in The Holmes Brothers' storied and still-evolving history. It's also their most bluesy album to date, filled with roadhouse wisdom, late-night doo wop, proto rock 'n' roll punch, soulful R&B and closing with an amazing dose of Sunday morning spirit. Featuring fourteen songs including eight new Holmes Brothers originals and six carefully-chosen covers BROTHERHOOD finds The Holmes Brothers at the absolute top of their game, creating timeless roots music. From the rocking Wendell original ''Stayed At The Party,'' to the sweet harmonies of Ted Hawkins' ''I Gave Up All I Had,'' to Sherman's soulful composition ''Passing Through,'' to the doo wop splendor of Popsy's vocals on the Stax classic ''My Kind Of Girl,'' to Wendell's gorgeous duet with his daughter Felicia on ''Loving You From Afar,'' to the final note of the band's most requested song and a highlight of each and every live performance the soul-stirring ''Amazing Grace,'' BROTHERHOOD is a testament to the uplifting musical power that comes from the close-knit, fraternally telepathic relationship of The Holmes Brothers. ''As much as I love all of our albums, this is among my favorites,'' says Wendell. ''We worked hard. We tried for a live, loose feel and we got it.'' <br><br>All of The Holmes Brothers' musical gifts are displayed in full force on BROTHERHOOD. With their deeply soulful singing, uplifting harmonies and unsurpassed musicianship, The Holmes Brothers' ability to deliver gospel fervor and raw blues intensity is as legendary as their ability to bring audiences to their feet.

Only a few years before her 1968 debut, Brigitte Fontaine Est...Folle, she moved to Paris to become an actress and took her prodigiously mature voice into the studio. Rich in the drama she brought to theater, Fontaine synthesized chanson (French pop song) and world music, which eventually won her international acclaim as a performer and collaborator with a variety of artists from around the world (Art Ensemble of Chicago, Sonic Youth and Stereolab, to name just a few). On Est...Folle, Fontaine takes flight over conductor Jean Claude Vannier s brilliant arrangements. Vannier, best known for his work on Serge Gainsbourg s Histoire De Melody Nelson, is in fine form, using what would become his trademark stylings: lush strings, taut rhythms culled from across the globe and a healthy dose of whimsy. Il Pleut swings from understatement to rapturous delight. Une Fois Mais Pas Deux is an infectious pop song that could have been culled from a French New Wave soundtrack. Fontaine is adventurous and multi-dimensional with sophisticated lyrics, poignant melodies and enthralling delivery. Such artful handling of meter and rhyme (or lack thereof) is rare in pop song. Far from the era s y-y phenomenon, but never fully removed from its traditions, Est...Folle is an essential link in French pop music, exuberantly pushing the genre into more conceptual and experimental sounds.']"

This compilation also will feature a fascinating new mini-documentary combining vintage audio interviews with Bloomfield and live performances with new reflections from his friends, collaborators and admirers.<br><br>Guitarist Mike Bloomfield never fully got his due as one of the go-to sidemen of his generation or for his importance as a common thread in the patchwork of genres that changed the face of rock and roll in the 1960s and 1970s - until now. Bloomfield's incredible career will be chronicled in From His Head to His Heart to His Hands.<br><br>Raised on the North Side of Chicago, Bloomfield's guitar prowess was immediately obvious; emulating the architects of the genre and fusing their style to the more experimental strains of 1960s pop and rock. Legendary A&R man John Hammond saw the same sort of raw talent in him that he saw in some of his greatest discoveries, from Bob Dylan to Bruce Springsteen, and would sign Bloomfield to Columbia Records. Bloomfield would make history for the label as a session guitarist for Dylan's iconic Highway 61 Revisited in 1965, featuring the incendiary &#34;Like a Rolling Stone.&#34;<br><br>Bloomfield was an original member of The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, contributing to their 1965 self-titled debut and follow-up East-West (1966); the latter album s title track, co-written by Bloomfield, is regarded as a high watermark in rock history, combining elements of blues, jazz, psychedelia and Eastern musical concepts in equal measure. From there, Bloomfield founded the famed &#34;American Music Band&#34; The Electric Flag, and fronted it into 1968. Also in 1968, Mike partook in the recording of Moby Grape's Grape Jam and the platinum-selling Super Session LP, a collaboration with fellow session legend Al Kooper.<br><br>As the decade wore on, Bloomfield would continue to release innovative, guitar-heavy works, including his debut solo album It's Not Killing Me and My Labors with Electric Flag member Nick Gravenites, both released in 1969. The remainder of his career was perhaps best known for more session highlights, including work on Muddy Waters Fathers And Sons and Janis Joplin's solo debut I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama! - all the while recording a series of highly-regarded solo works.<br><br>Bloomfield died at the too-young age of 37; only afterward did his reputation solidify as a building block of the 1960s' popular music evolution, his peerless guitar work one of the few common threads in a decade of musical change.<br><br>At long last, Bloomfield will truly get his due with From His Head to His Heart to His Hands. <br><br>DVD - SWEET BLUES: A FILM ABOUT MIKE BLOOMFIELD<br>A Ravin' Film.

Crispian St. Peters was a folk/pop singer-songwriter who enjoyed significant success in the mid-'60s, his career fueled by some infamous boasts about his musical talents (his claim that he was better than Elvis and The Beatles caused an outrage at the time). Signing to Decca in 1965, Crispian broke through with the UK # 2 hit 'You Were On My Mind' in 1966 (it also made the Top 40 Stateside), followed by perhaps his most famous song, 'The Pied Piper', which was Top 5 on both sides of the Atlantic. He also had a minor UK/US hit with 'Changes'. The Pied Piper does exactly what it says on the package: for the first time, this remastered set offers Crispian's complete recorded output for various labels across nigh on a decade, starting with early singles 'At This Moment' and 'No, No, No' and ending with a one-off single for Santa Ponsa. Both of Crispian's albums are represented in their entirety: his 1966 Decca album Follow Me... and his scarce 1970 album for the obscure Square label, Simply Crispian St. Peters. Several recordings on this authoritative 50-track package made their debut on this set. Also included are his single under the pseudonym Country Smith, and several tracks boasting sessioneers Jimmy Page and Big Jim Sullivan on guitar. The Pied Piper offers Crispian St. Peters's entire recordings from 1965-1974 in one place, remastered with detailed sleevenotes in the accompanying booklet. Sadly, Crispian passed away in 2010 but this new package offers a fitting epitaph to his musical legacy.""]"

Each track of sounds offers something beautiful and just as indescribable. Glorious, heavenly, celestial, esoteric: these are just a few words that come to my mind when trying to explain this music. Origen gives a thorough and personal working over to Donizetti- aria Una Fortiva Lagrima, Handel - Lascia Chio Pianga, Mozart  Requiem, Lacrimosa, Ave Maria by Schubert, among others. Obviously, these pieces would never be complete without Tanya Lubimenko a singer of the Ukrainian National Opera House, whose voice is possibly one of the most beautiful voices on this planet.

The album's hit singles, especially 'Nigger' and 'The Truth', had serious impact on the alternative club scene and are celebrated tracks until this day. So 'Deafer Dumber Blinder' (as the title implies) give you more: revised artwork, 2 bonus CD's and a live DVD, lots of unreleased and rare material - all added to the classic album.""]"

The minimal detour was reaching its logical endpoint, and producers were returning to the 1990s for inspiration, with Berghain and Sandwell District at the vanguard of a new techno movement. What the Aquaplano sessions shared in common were slower BPMs and finding inspiration in the 1990s, but there they parted ways. The influences these Italians were drawing on were rather different, returning to tribal rhythms and ambient textures to sketch out a much more heady, psychedelic form of techno. The results were a perfect balance of hypnotic beats and swirling atmosphere geared for a broken-in dancefloor or the hazy afterhours. Across these two records <B>Donato Dozzy</B> and <B>Nuel</B> would go a long way towards creating the template for a brand of deep, atmospheric techno that has become much more prominent in the years since. And while many have sought to imitate this sound, few -- if any -- have matched what first emerged from the Aquaplano sessions. After only being available in a very limited run, it is fitting that the sonic blueprints provided by Dozzy and Nuel are now available again -- and much more widely -- at a time when their influence is as strong as it has ever been.

Originally formed in 1973, The 'Tators proved to be way ahead of the game by straddling the worlds of hard rock, proto-punk and punk rock. All Music Guide called them 'New York proto-punk heroes who fused vintage rock & roll to a trashy pop-culture aesthetic'. The group's retro-rock, back alley punk stance confounded expectations every step of the way, but with studio production courtesy of the tag-team behind the Blue Oyster Cult, Murray Krugman and Sandy Pearlman their records retain a timeless, diamond-hard edge. Debut album Go Girl Crazy! (1975) was a landmark of its day, boasting 'The Next Big Thing', 'Master Race Rock' and their era-defining cover of 'California Sun'. Manifest Destiny (1977) proved the 'Tators were 'Young, Fast, Scientific' while laying waste to the world with their incendiary cover of Iggy & the Stooges 'Search and Destroy'. Third album Bloodbrothers (1978) yielded some of their best-ever songs in 'Faster & Louder' and 'Stay with Me'. The group originally broke up in 1978, but has reformed on a number of occasions and their 2001 album D.F.F.D. saw them at the top of their game with attitude-to-burn classics such as 'I Am Right!' and 'Burn, Baby, Burn!!'.

Today, Mr. Jansons ranks as one of the foremost interpreters of Russian symphonic music. Two Sixth Symphonies, both composed by Russians and both first performed in St. Petersburg/Leningrad. The two works are confessions in music, written by composers who had to conceal their true natures and thoughts from the political and social realities surrounding them, and consequently took the risk of \'saying the unsayable\' through music. Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky\'s Sixth Symphony, first performed in 1893 only a few days before his death, is the work of an artist for whom the symphony was the """"musical confession of a soul which, filled to bursting from the effects of life, unburdens itself through sound."""" Tchaikovsky wanted the programme of this symphony later termed the """"Pathtique"""" to remain """"a mystery to all."""" And the """"Pathtique"""" did indeed only become a success once its creator had died. Echoing Tchaikovsky\'s mysterious musical legacy, Dmitri Shostakovich\'s Symphony No. 6 also puzzled people through its lack of symphonic conventions there is, for instance, no joyful and victorious finale. In 1939, despite the fact that Stalin\'s regime with its cultural repression had long kept him under observation, Shostakovich produced a Sixth Symphony that prompted stormy applause from the audience, yet left the critics and ideologists nonplussed: They referred to it as a """"headless torso"""". The """"healthy joy in life"""" promoted by the doctrine of socialist realism is nowhere in evidence here: instead, the symphony conveys a powerful sense of gloom, filled with glaringly grotesque exaggerations. The first performance of Shostakovich\'s symphonic masterpiece was conducted by Yevgeny Mravinsky; Mariss Jansons would later become his student and assistant. As an interpreter, the Latvian-born chief conductor of the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks thus has a direct link to the composer. Both symphonies were recorded only very recently at exciting live performances in Munich\'s main concert halls.']"

He was a pianist equally at home in Beethoven, Liszt and Schumann, composers who formed the centre of his repertoire in later years. By the mid-1930s, Arrau was giving marathon recitals of the complete keyboard works of Bach and Mozart. In 1938, he performed for the first time the complete sonatas and concertos by Beethoven. He recorded a vast discography for EMI and Philips which included selected Beethoven sonatas for EMI in the 1950s and the complete sonatas for Philips between 1962 and 1966. Arrau was a deeply thoughtful musician who tried to get to the heart ofthe work he was performing with an interpretation illuminated by his wide knowledge of art and literature (Jonathan Summers). This recording is extremely rare and has never been issued before. It is considered in some circles that Arraus live performances of the Beethoven sonatas are superior to the studio versions. Joseph Horowitz has stated I do not find his (studio recorded) cycle conveys Arraus full stature as a Beethoven player. In the later sonatas, Arrau himself alluded to the fact that an improvisatory approach was required which was difficult to achieve within the constraints of a recording studio. Of Op. 111, Jonathan Summers says in his booklet note that as we near the close of the performance we realise that we have been transported to another world by Arrau the result of great music interpreted by a great musician. Of Op. 57, the Appassionata, Summers states that Arrau plays the work not as a virtuoso display piece but as a conflict between life and death. These three sonatas were recorded live in Stockholmwith exceptional warmth and clarity in 1960, when Arrau was at the peak of his career. They show that he was one of the most accomplished Beethoven interpreters of the 20th century (Jonathan Summers).']"

A wizard of the orchestra!.. A magician of orchestral sounds!.. How many unforgettable pages from Rimsky-Korsakovs scores arise as I say it! The wonderful composer created a bright orchestral style which we with good reason call Rimsky-Korsakovs orchestra, wrote the patriarch of the 20th century Russian conducting school Evgeni Svetlanov. The composer developed various genres of symphonic music for forty-five years. Conventional four-movement symphonic cycles; one-movement programme overtures, fantasia on folk themes and symphonic pictures in the vein of the founder of the New Russian School Mily Balakirev; Capriccio espagnol continuing Glinkas line; individual orchestra pieces composed in case Rimsky-Korsakov did not come at once to the genre of symphonic suite, the most organic for his creative individuality, in which he created Antar and Scheherazade, two masterpieces of Russian orchestra music. Rimsky-Korsakovs works are performed by the USSR State Academic Symphony Orchestra conducted by Evgeni Svetlanov. The recordings were made in the late 1960s early 1980s in the heyday of the orchestra and its outstanding leader.']"

The triumphant premieres of Symphonies Nos 1 and 2, with their big tunes and great romantic sweep, established the international reputation of Sibelius as a symphonist, some audiences even considering him Beethovens natural successor. The symphonies that followed chart Sibeliuss development as one of the most individual composers of the early twentieth century. Each symphony has its unique approach, whether it be the classicism of the Third, the brooding modernism of the Fourth, or the icy stillness of the Sixth, so evocative of the Finnish landscape. The Symphony No. 7 in C major represents Sibeliuss greatest achievement in the symphonic form. In it he compresses the grand emotional sweep of a symphony into one startlingly original movement lasting little over twenty minutes. Illness prevented Sibelius from completing any major works in the last thirty years of his life. Manuscripts show, however, that he never stopped composing. Recorded here are three orchestral fragments prepared by Timo Virtanen from late sketches thought to be for Sibeliuss legendary lost 8th Symphony, destroyed by the composer in 1945. They offer a fascinating glimpse into the composers creative imagination during a time when impaired health inhibited Sibelius from realising his rich musical visions.']"

Even before The Robe opened, the canny Twentieth Century Fox production chief, Darryl F. Zanuck, had Demetrius and the Gladiators under way. Robe veterans, writer Philip Dunne, producer Frank Ross, art directors George W. Davis and Lyle Wheeler, and actors Victor Mature, Michael Rennie, and Jay Robinson were now freshly energized by newcomers; director Delmer Daves, cinematographer Milton Krasner, and composer Waxman replaced their counterparts still occupied on The Robe: Henry Koster, Leon Shamroy, and Newman.', 'The surprise is that, while The Robe eclipsed its successor in its day, decades later, it looks like Demetrius is, in fact, what screenwriter Philip Dunne called it: a far better pure movie. And one of the true pleasures of the film is Franz Waxman s tantalizing score, which, while incorporating several of Alfred Newman s incomparably majestic themes from The Robe, nevertheless manages to display a modernist lan and power all its own. Demetrius and the Gladiators was this fabulously versatile composer s first Biblical epic; as usual, he adapted his talents to a new genre with superbly dramatic dexterity. Beginning with a pulse-pounding Prelude which twines Newman s themes with his own, Waxman moves on to one stunning cue after another.', 'Demetrius and the Gladiators has undergone a long overdue full digital restoration using the best that state-of-the-art audio technology can offer. Restoration and remixing was undertaken at 96k 24bit resolution. Sadly, three cues from the score had completely deteriorated by the time the original reels were transferred in 1997: Kneel to Your God (6m3/7m1), Temptation (7m2), and The Kiss (8m1). Using the original 4-track stereo audio for the film itself, we have rescued brief segments of these, which were unmarred by dialogue and sound effects and included them in the program in order to present as much of the score as possible. An additional excerpt of Temptation, with sound effects but no dialogue, is included as a bonus track. Also in the bonus section is the deteriorated stereo version of the cue Claudius and Caligula, while the main program features a more sonically palatable monaural mix. Every effort has been made to bring out its original brilliance so that, as a listening experience, Demetrius may take its rightful place beside recent musical restorations of other Fox Biblical epics of the period.', '']"

These are represented by his """"Alpine Symphony"""" as well as the four symphonic interludes from his 1924 opera """"Intermezzo"""". The lightweight and entertaining music of this """"bourgeois comedy"""" contrasts starkly with the poetic and powerfully sonorous symphonic treatment given to its four interludes. These were transferred by Strauss from the opera to the concert hall, where they are still firmly established today. For Richard Strauss, writing poetry in tones was a central artistic credo. What Beethoven, Berlioz and Liszt had begun was perfected in the Munich-born composer\'s great tone poems: """"Don Juan"""", """"Till Eulenspiegel"""", """"Thus Spake Zarathustra"""", and his final work of symphonic programme music """"An Alpine Symphony"""", completed in 1915. In this work, which is a summit in the musical depiction of nature in its own right, Strauss sends the listener on a tour through the mountains and has him experience pastures, waterfalls, undergrowth, glaciers, the elation of reaching the summit, and also a thunderstorm. Beneath the surface, however, the """"Alpine Symphony"""", which Strauss originally entitled """"The Antichrist"""", has several echoes of Beethoven and Wagner and especially in the sections entitled Night, Vision and Elegy leads us subtly into philosophically charged soundscapes intended to convey """"moral purification through one\'s own strength"""" and also """"worship of eternal and magnificent nature.""""']"

The name of this English composer is not yet well known to Russian listeners. Meanwhile, Vaughan Williams was one of the largest figures of the so-called English Musical Renaissance, a movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A composer, conductor, organist, folklore student and publicist, Vaughan Williams today is mostly known for his large-scale symphonic works. The English composers nine symphonies sequentially reflect the evolution of his creative style (the first one was composed in 1903, and the last one not long before he died in 1958). Each of them seems to be a continuation, a development of the previous one (a sort of chapters of one novel), but neither repeats any other one in structure, composition, concept or music. Some of the symphonies are closely connected with national poetry (Walt Whitman), episodes from the English history or pictures of native countryside. Absorbing a wide range of sources realized in Vaughan Williamss style from old folk songs and religious hymns to musical impressionism and jazz his symphonies are notable for expressive figurativeness and melodic resourcefulness, and open to any keen ear. The recordings of Vaughan Williamss symphonies performed by the prominent conductor and recognized master of interpretation of 20th century music were made at concerts in 19881989 in Leningrad.']"

There is no better place to spend time absorbing the nuances of art and song than where they evolved. There might not be any location more important to the development of modern music than the island nation of Cuba with its unique amalgamation of races and nationalities mixing and blending to create genres that have influenced the rest of the world.<br><br>In January 2000, Sunnyside became aware of the extraordinary tres player, Aldo del Rio. Subsequently, El Bardo was recorded thus preserving a fabulous example of Cuban son by one of its leading practitioners. <br><br>It was on a tour to del Rio s native Pinar del Ro province - the farthest west province in Cuba and the largest tobacco-producing region in the country - where we heard the master tresero for the first time. Del Rio impressed with his amazing style on the tres cubano, a six-string guitar like instrument allegedly of Spanish origins that was developed in Eastern Cuba to perform the Afro-Cuban music from the region. The instrument has three sets of two strings, which provide a unique harp like sound due to the sympathetic strings. <br><br>In March 2000, a recording was made under the leadership of trombonist Juan Pablo Torres entitled Son Que Chevere (Circular Moves, 2000). Del Rio was featured prominently on the recording. It was during this session that the decision to record the tresero was made. <br><br>The recording of Del Rio s small conjunto ensemble was made the following June at the famed Estudios Abdala in the Miramar section of Havana. The tremendous document has been waiting for release until now. <br><br>The twelve tracks presented on El Bardo are a collection of songs made popular over the years in Cuba over the past 80 years. <br><br>The recording begins with trovadore Manuel Corona s Aurora, a clave driven lament featuring del Rio s aching vocals, followed by Spanish songwriter Juan Carlos Caldern s Tmame O Djame, a mid tempo piece with the narrator asking his lover to be truthful, whether the lover stays or goes. Deja Que Hablen De Mi is a moving del Rio original that boldly proclaims the love of the narrator to another, without shame. Bola de Nieve s beautiful ballad Si Me Pudieras Querer is wonderfully performed, as del Rio draws out the emotions with his solo vocal and tres as he heralds his love in the face of fate and the Gods.<br><br>Deriving from the chorus of the great Arsenio Rodriguez s Yo Soy El Terror, del Rio s Congo De Ampanga is a rhythmic celebration of the tresero s African roots. Popular Mexican guitarist and songwriter Nicho Hinojosa s El Bardo is a romantic yet tragic ballad of the love of a society girl who fell in love with a troubadour who meets a sad demise, while the lyrics of the prolific Colombian composer Jos Barros s rambunctious El Aguacero are rushed wildly as if in a drunken haze. The wonderful solo rendition of romantic Mexican composer Armando Manzanero s Ma insures that his lover will always be his, no matter what happens. <br><br>Celebrated Cuban poet and vocalist Luis Carbonell s Tu Eres Plante Na Ma is given a playful rendition, perfect for its tongue in cheek prose. Miguel Matamoros s dramatic Lagrimas Negras descriptively conjures the pain of a lover s abandonment, while the uptempo take of Parmenio Salazar Jstiz s Cayetano Baila Bembe is ready for swaying hips and dancing feet. The recording concludes with Ramn Espigui s La Rosa Oriental, featuring a wonderful call and response coro and montuno featuring a tres solo.']"
B00K0NALS8,AHGZYB93YOQK8,1,1423526400,Rough Guide To Arabic Jazz,Various,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'World Music']","['The syncopated beats and counter-culture attitudes synonymous with universal jazz culture have been swinging in the Arab world since the early twentieth century. The western Arabic region, the Maghreb, has historic ties with Andalucian Spain and the stamping off-beats heard in flamenco, which feeds back into local jazz expressions. The eastern Mashriq region has a solid jazz heritage underlined by the careers of musicians such as drummer Salah Ragab who worked with outer-planetary superstar Sun Ra. The oeuvre of the Beirut-born Rahbani brothers, did much to expand the jazz vocabulary of Lebanon. Jazz is still pulsing through the veins of Arabic homelands and this Rough Guide offers up an insight in to the scene. Lebanons rich musical melting pot is to thank for many of the tracks on this album. Lebanese trumpeter and composer Ibrahim Maaloufs opener, Nomade Slang, is anchored by an undulating double-time drum pattern with sharp stinging horn lines and inquisitive rising bass figures. It was Ibrahims musician father Nassim that altered his trumpet to four valves making it quarter-tone and allowing him to play Arabic maqamat (modes). Another Beirut-born musician contributes A Better Tomorrow. Rabih Abou-Khalil is a master oud player who brings out a slinky, seductive flavour with brushed drums and a languorous wind solo. The haunting track Harrama el-Nawma is performed by Rima Khcheich, a singer from Khiam in the south of the country. Ahmad Kaabour is also from Lebanon and a prominent cultural figure in the Middle East: his 1975 hit Oundaikom became the anthem of the Palestinian struggle. Abou Afif was released in 2012 and is a peppy, almost saccharine number that encapsulates the feel of modernist 1970s jazz with bright-toned funk-inflected keyboard and a chorus of female backing vocals. Le Trio Jourban hail from Nazareth, Palestine and offer up the track Masr, a gently pulsing performance that illuminates the iridescent delicacy of the stringed oud. Daramad count in the proceedings with the track Tigris Eye. The bands line-up features a mix of Persian and Australian musicians allowing them to create a delicate musical dialogue that discusses the confluence of traditional Eastern music and improvised jazz. Omar Faruk Tekbilek was born of Turkish and Egyptian parents and currently resides in America. Dark Eyes is inspired by Sufi devotional music and ambient electronica. Maurice El Mdioni stirs a potent punch with Cuban percussionist Roberto Rodriguez on the closing track Ana Ouna. The piano part ripples around Arabic melodic patterns, turning and twisting in small oscillations, while a countering trumpet hammers home the Cuban big band aesthetic. The Rough Guide To Arabic Jazz also features a bonus album by Hijaz, a group formed by Tunisian master oud player Moufadhel Adhoum and pianist Niko Deman. Their album Chemsi, meaning sun, reflects the beauty and warmth of these stunning compositions.']"

Then they were known as The Carnations, although they evolved in to The Cadillacs during their first recording session in 1954. A year later, they recorded what was to become their biggest hit in Speedo, a #3 R&B and #17 pop hit in 1955. The group splintered in to two factions in 1957 only to re-assemble in 1958. Further break-ups occurred in 1959 and 1960, by which time the group had begun to sound more like The Coasters (and one of their members would go on to join that rival group). By 1962 The Cadillacs were following musical trends rather than setting them as in their heyday, although Twisting With The Cadillacs, issued on the Jubilee label, is still worthy of attention. There is a re-recorded version of their major hit Speedo and another in Peek-A-Boo (#20 R&B and #28 pop) in what is a fell good album of twist material.']"

All this has made for a great deal of literature on the composer, and here we have the opportunity to become acquainted with a number of his violin sonatas which remained unpublished during his lifetime, including hitherto unrecorded repertoire. Guiding artist Valerio Lositos approach to these works is the implementation of his tripartite scheme to know, to understand and to interpret. In the case of works such as the Sonata for Solo Violin in A major, brilliant in style and clearly an original composition, this proves essential, as the issue surrounding the middle movements division into two staves, violin and basso, is explained when we realise that the melody and accompaniment can both by effected on the violin. Veracinis style is virtuosic, as one would expect, and his handling of harmony and structure is highly individual. Also included on the compilation are three canons, two from the composers treatise Il trionfo della pratica musica (composed around 1765 as his Opera Terza but never published) and one from the Sonate Accademiche of 1744, in the guise of a poetic couplet that seems to sum up the composers own life experience. A handful of engaging Preludes, for either harpsichord or violin, complete the collection. Violinist Valerio Losito offers a highly stylised, character-laden performance, drawing attention through the implementation of his scheme to what is for _ him the most important aspect of music: its human nature in other words its original message one which connects our time with that of Veracini, rendering the composer immortal. He is joined on the recording by early music expert and harpsichordist Federico Del Sordo.']"

Comprised of some of the most seasoned, highly respected players in NOLA, the group called themselves The Unusual Suspects. Their chemistry was undeniable and by the summer of 2011 they decided to tour full-time, renaming the band New Orleans Suspects.

Adept at James Booker-style piano and the swelling B-3 stylings of Art Neville, Gruver has also become a well-regarded sideman for Leo Nocentelli of The Meters. <br><br>Jeff Watkins is an accomplished sax player, engineer and producer. He spent twelve years leading the James Brown Band, including Brown's induction into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. He also worked for six years with Joss Stone as her producer, engineer, and bandleader. <br><br>The two albums New Orleans Suspects have released since 2011 include their eponymous debut studio album and a live recording, Caught Live at the Maple Leaf, which made it into the iTunes highly competitive 'New and Noteworthy' page. <br>Their upcoming release, Ouroboros, is an all-original studio album that characterizes the band's sound and places them in a class of their own. Putting a contemporary twist on the funk, rock, and R&B traditions of New Orleans music, this album is like taking a wild ride through they city's musical history in a brand new vehicle. Ouroboros will be released on Louisiana Red Hot Records and distributed by E-1 in October of 2014 and will give the band their first shot at a national marketing campaign - including a radio push for their first single 'Soothe Me,' written by Mr. Eckert. As always, the band will continue to keep the hot in support of the new release."", ""'Want to hear a Supergroup? Catch the Suspects...' --Jamband.com<br /><br />New Orleans has given us some of the most joyful music on the planet, from zydeco to funk, from dixieland to jazz. Arguably, it probably has more musicians in residence than any other city in the USA. Five of these veteran musicians have now come together in the New Orleans Suspects: Mean Willie Green, celebrated drummer for the Neville Brothers; bassist Reggie Scanlan of the Radiators; Dirty Dozen Brass Band guitarist Jake Eckert; keyboardist CR Gruver, who's played with Outformation, Leo Nocentelli, and Angie Aparo; and sax man Jeff Watkins, who led James Brown's band for 12 years before becoming Joss Stone's band leader for the next six. <br><br>To call the New Orleans Suspects a supergroup is an understatement, and their second studio album Ouroboros is a masterpiece of New Orleans funk/rock. Channeling the vibe right off the bat, the band sets the tone with the lead-off track Get Back What You Given, when they sing Hey na na, fee na ney, think I'm gonna take a holiday... That kind of joy pervades this album, with second-line rhythms providing plenty of excitement for the feet, and great counterpoint and harmonic interplay between the horns, guitar and keyboards that'll make your ears happy. <br><br>I've seen the Suspects twice at festivals, and I can vouch for their thrilling live performance. I highly recommend that you see these guys ... they will make you dance, smile, laugh and dance some more. While you're there, pick up Ouroboros and take home the fun. You ll be so glad, you'll Iko Iko all day! --The Corner News<br /><br />Though Ouroboros (Louisiana Red Hot Records) is the third album from the New Orleans Suspects, CR Gruver, who's on keyboards, electric kazoo, drums and vocals, says it's really more like the band's first.<br><br>'It's our first all-original studio (album), so we're kind of putting it out there, making a statement as to who we are as a band and who we are, musically,' he says. 'There were a lot of misconceptions about who we were in the beginning, people thought we were just a supergroup, just a collection of people from other bands. We felt like we were more than that, more of an actual band.'<br><br>Jake Eckert and Jeff Watkins both helped write and produce the album, out Oct. 14. Eckert, who's on strings, drums and vocals, says the album attempts to walk listeners through various styles of New Orleans music, track by track. 'From New Orleans funk aspects, to another tune that may have some Mardi Gras Indian tune on it, to another that may have some Southern rock, swamp rock kind of vibe to an Earl King kind of vibe,' he says. 'That was part of the idea we had in our minds.'<br>&#34;Magdalena&#34; blends several styles, beginning as a funky track with a snaky melody, ultimately ending in what you'd expect to hear coming from the corner of a smoky New Orleans bar. Watkins, who plays saxophone and a handful of other instruments and also sings on the album, is partial to the jazz funeral number, aptly titled 'In Your Mind', which carefully balances structure with improvisation, complete with all the fanfare of a hot New Orleans day but with nods to the influence of New Orleans musicians of days gone by, namely James Booker and King. --Gambit Weekly""]"

For the present instalment, Sakari Oramo has chosen the composer's first attempt in the genre, completed in 1892: a work by a composer still in his mid-twenties, and mindful if not overly respectful of previous models. Thoroughly classical in its proportions, Symphony No. 1 owes much to Schumann, while at the same time displaying affinities with the fieriness of Berlioz, with the lyrical tone of Grieg, and with the rhythmic vitality of Grieg's fellow-Norwegian Johan Svendsen, who conducted the work's premire. (In later years Nielsen often conducted his own music, but at this time he was still dependent on his income as an orchestral player, and sat among the second violins.) If the work met with a certain sympathy - one influential critic wrote that the work promised 'a coming storm of genius' - what might be termed Carl Nielsen's 'definitive' breakthrough as a symphonist only came some 20 years later, with the premire of Symphony No. 3, later subtitled Sinfonia espansiva. The work was described by one reviewer as 'genuinely Carl Nielsenesque in all its strange mixture of naivet and refinement, humour and lyricism, violence and grace', and it was soon taken up by orchestras across Europe. In the second movement, Andante pastorale, Nielsen unusually adds vocalises for solo soprano and baritone: as he put it in one of his programme notes, the aim was 'to underscore the peaceful atmosphere you might imagine in Paradise before the Fall of our first parents, Adam and Eve'. The movement was played at Carl Nielsen's funeral, in Copenhagen Cathedral on 9th October 1931.""]"

Springtime Carnivore is the nom de tune of Greta Morgan. Produced by Morgan and sonic wizard Richard Swift (The Black Keys, The Shins, Foxygen) the album crackles with warmth, employing faded strings, blown-out drums, fuzzy guitars, and pawnshop keyboards to adorn widescreen vocals. Due out November 4th from Aquarium Drunkard s Autumn Tone Records, the album builds on a foundation of classic folk and pop songwriting, synthesizing those roots with production that turns and careens unexpectedly, shooting her melodic songs in varied light and from surprising angles: Name on a Matchbook merges off kilter grooves to a strident glide; Sun Went Black charges marries fuzzy power pop to wistful longing; Other Side of the Boundary is an aching psychedelic ballad, at once intimate but also cosmically faraway. Springtime Carnivore makes songs that sound familiar but skewed. Already a music veteran, Springtime Carnivore recently completed a tour supporting legendary soft psych band The Zombies, with whom she shares a distinct melodic touch. The songs on the album utilize classic approaches, but are distinctly modern. There s an index card tacked to the wall of Morgan s rehearsal space.

The Serenades have been unjustly neglected and are rarely heard in concert, making them perfect repertoire for Chailly s enquiring mind. Widely respected as a conductor with a rare talent for transforming music ripe for rediscovery (Gramophone), his reading of the Serenades fits with his philosophy that all music must aspire to be new music again . The recording follows Chailly s multi-award-winning sets of the Brahms and Beethoven symphonies.<br>Chailly s radical approach to the symphonies produced a recording of trademark clarity according to Gramophone, which made the set its Record of the Year 2014 . It also won a BBC Music Magazine Award, the jury commenting: Chailly combines fiery athleticism with the warmly blended tonalities of the wonderful Leipzig orchestra. The results tingle with immediacy and a pulsating sense of momentum. Now Chailly brings the same questing spirit to the Serenades. The release highlights the importance of this repertoire in Brahms s evolution as a composer and orchestrator, making a significant statement and allowing the Serenades to emerge from the shadow of the symphonies. Newly reassessed as substantial masterworks in their own right, they show Brahms in an unexpected light: the Op. 11 offering a brightness, waggishness and humour that would later become rare in Brahms, in the words of musicologist Peter Korfmacher, while the Op. 16 Serenade is exotically scored for just wind and lower strings, creating a sense of pleasant shade rather than darkness. With playing that is multifaceted, multi-coloured light and delicate. The double-bass jokes can generate their wit, the music swings, and the colours glow, says Chailly.<br>With his extraordinary attention to detail and keen ear for musical nuance, Riccardo Chailly really gets to the heart of this richly rewarding music. This is the first Decca recording of these works since Istvn Kertsz recorded them in 1968. It is a worthy successor to another great Brahmsian and a historic recording which will bring new life to concert-hall rarities that are ripe for rediscovery.', 'For an orchestra as steeped in the Austro-German tradition as the Gewandhaus is, playing Brahms has always been part of its raison d tre.

Made with a certain vibe, in a special location, or at a crucial time in which the artist is living. The story of Dutch Rock singer Anouk\'s new album Paradise And Back Again is quite the opposite; there is no theme or concept to this album.

A trip through all styles the singer loves. Or, as she says herself: ""It\'s a mess, really"". Typically Anouk: first, sing a bunch of songs with all her heart and soul, only to make fun of it moments later. She explains: ""We live in a time where everything is OK, anything goes. Everybody listens to so many different musical styles at the same time, something I have always done. So why stick to one style, when you master multiple?""']"

The album\'s first single is called ""Sometimes,""produced by Gordon Voidwell. Heems wrote about the new song in a statement: Sometimes is about dualities, identity and the space between spaces. Like so many other people, as a first generation South Asian in the U.S. I often felt like I lived two lives, an Indian one and an American one. I lived, at once, in and between two spaces and outside them as well. On another level, I also often felt like in America I lived in the space between black and white. Dualities are normal though. As fun as rap is, I can\'t always feel happy. Sometimes I feel sad too. It also pays homage to hip-hop before me with cadences referencing both Nice and Smooth and Busta Rhymes. The album was recorded in Bombay and Brooklyn. It features guitar by Dev Hynes (Blood Orange) and Rafiq Bhatia. Hynes, Voidwell, Harry Fraud, and Boody B are among the album\'s producers.']"

B00R3DA1BK,A36L3NRW858ROT,1,1443916800,San Francisco 1970,Miles Davis,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Jazz']","[""As the 1960s wound to a close, Miles Davis was fearlessly forging ahead into new musical directions. Following the transitional In a Silent Way, the groundbreaking double album, Bitches Brew would signal an entirely new musical form that found Davis embracing electronic instrumentation and amplification. By 1970, Davis was performing before the largest audiences of his career, often opening for popular rock bands of the era. He had opened for The Band at the Hollywood Bowl, and on Fillmore East bills for headliners Laura Nyro and Neil Young & Crazy Horse. He also played a multi-night run in April '70 opening for the Grateful Dead at Fillmore West. These performances brought Davis a new younger audience that might not have understood the genesis of his music, but dug it just the same. It's a telling comment on Miles' relentlessly forward-looking vision that a mere sixteen months after recording Bitches Brew, and barely eight months after releasing it to unprecedented commercial success, he had effectively dropped most of its material from his live repertoire. On this performance, Davis focuses primarily on new compositions (What I Say, Honky Tonk, Funky Tonk, and Yesternow), with only eleven minutes of the hour-plus performance exploring established cuts Bitches Brew and Sanctuary. Yesternow, a ferocious track Davis had recorded the previous April for the Tribute to Jack Johnson film, is followed by the title track from Bitches Brew, concluding with another new composition, Funky Tonk. During the nearly 35 minutes of music contained in these last three pieces, the group's power and precision is nothing short of astounding. Apart from the set-closing cue of The Theme, little of this music derives from Miles' jazz period, nor does it fall into the free jazz category that it is so often mistakenly associated with. This music is much funkier, often comprised of deep, one chord, cyclical grooves that have little in common with jazz.""]"

Abandoning the big time studio, the band decided to head back home to self-record and self-produce their third full-length album. Free of major-label-influence, Surfer Blood has delivered a uniquely compelling album, unlike anything in their catalog. The story of 1000 Palms began on January 1st 2014, after playing a New Year\'s show in Portland, OR. The band decided to stick around for the rest of the month, renting a practice space and sorting through a backlog of ideas. By February, as their lease ran out, Surfer Blood had recorded demos for most of the tracks that are now featured on their third LP. After a frustrating time at their previous home, Warner Brothers, the quartet was beyond ready to return to a more DIY recording process, completely void of the middlemen scrutinizing every bar of previous LP, Pythons. With the band self-recording, it was in the glamorous setting of an attic studio above a doctor\'s office where drums were committed to tape. Of the work, frontman John Paul Pitts states ""fortunately none of us are strangers to DIY recording, so this seemed like the kind of challenge well-suited to our band"". The making of 1000 Palms also owes a lot to the kindness of friends and family, with the remaining instrument sessions taking place at the home of drummer Tyler Schwartz\'s parents, while they were on vacation. Following a few days of very little sleep and after the band pooled resources and called in favors, the band had managed to craft everything you now hear on the upcoming record.']"

What remains unchanged is his passion to collect old-fashioned instruments and use. So on the album a sumptuous selection of such instruments, including a Wurlitzer piano, a harpsichord, a Mellotron and an antique Steinway piano, which Gardner bought from a church. His sound is close to artists like Syd Barrett or Curt Boettcher, which also parallels with John Maus or Tame Impala can be seen and the dynamics of Gardner\'s compositions can be compared to bands like Stereolab or Simon & Garfunkel with. Yet for all the love that Gardner has to vintage instruments and their sound, it is by no means an attempt of imitation of old-fashioned music. Rather, it is about creating a unique and personal style.

First conceptualized as a freak-folk solo act by Frances Quinlan, it progressed towards a fuller sound with the addition of Mark Quinlan on drums, Tyler Long on bass and Joe Reinhart (Algernon Cadwallader, Dogs on Acid) on guitar. Emerging as one of musics most unique songwriters, the captivating vignettes Frances has weaved tell vivid stories of desperation and weary awakening. Her powerful voice is a spellbinding entity all its own, celebratory and raw, and one that cant be shaken away.  Their new album, Painted Shut, is their 2nd full-length and first for Saddle Creek (preceded by the self-released Get Disowned in 2012). However, this release marks their first time creating as a full-formed entity, arranging everything as a group. It was co-produced, recorded and mixed by John Agnello (Kurt Vile, Dinosaur Jr., Sonic Youth, etc.) in the great cities of Philadelphia and Brooklyn, and incidentally finished in the shortest span of time the band has ever made anything.  Like their debut, Painted Shut is a series of accounts, a procession of fleeting and repeating characters. However, it diverges from its predecessor in its close-up, controlled approach (most of the album features the band recording live), and more focused portraiture. Whereas Get Disowned calls forth a dreamy collage of protagonists in a tone thats often anthemic and surreal, Painted Shut is a grounded, less merciful image of many struggling adults (and children) in a severe landscape.  Often depicted in Painted Shut are the two lives of legendary (though generally unknown) musicians, Buddy Bolden and Jackson C. Frank, who were plagued with mental illness until their penniless deaths. Included are accounts of more everyday poverty, abuse, greed; and banal, sub-par behavior. Society is unveiled as a structure that, in reality, was most certainly not built with everyone in mind. Clearly this is difficult subject matter. Yet the songs themselves move unencumbered and easily, forming angular pop anti-anthems, at times jubilant as well as irreverent. Somehow, they are not sad songs. There is joy, in the abandon of Frances unforgettable voice, in the exulting choruses. One wakes to a sky that is a bright, ageless blue. Its morning and so clear outside that multitudes of lives can be seen, in focus despite the distance. All of this is viewed through a window sealed with cracked paint that cannot be opened on either side. That is how we must often view the lives of others, especially when it comes to people who have lived and gone from this world. Thats another story.']"

The song that gives the album its title is by Manuel de Falla, from his justifiably famous Seven Popular Spanish Songs, and there are also excerpts here from the Canciones negras of Montsalvatge. Much less often encountered outside their native countries are the songs of the Spaniard Antn Garca Abril (b.1933) and the Argentine composer Carlos Guastavino (19122000), both composing in a light and charming lyric style, shared by the early music of Guastavinos countryman Alberto Ginastera (191683), who later composed in a more Modernist vein. Few know that Spains greatest poet, Federico Garcia Lorca, gave his name to a collection of song-settings which he collected and arranged for soprano and piano: like several of the lullabies here, his setting presents a deliberate contrast between a disturbing lyric and a soothing melody. The accompaniment, with its echoes of flamenco, is clearly inspired by Andalusian folk music. Less reliant on folk models and more adventurous are the songs and piano works by Ernesto Halffter (190589): a 1920 Lullaby retains a soothing rhythm but is chromatically infected in the harmony. Nana del nio malo by Guillermo Alonso Iriarte and Nana de la lejana by Jorge Montero were written especially for this album and are therefore world premiere recordings. The Spanish soprano Carmen Solis has lately sung the lead role in Puccinis Madama Butterfly at the opera in Gijon: the required combination of power and purity for Cio-Cio San also serves her well in this song-collection.']"

The instrumentation is three Sequential Circuits PRO-1s, Crumar Traveler One, and a Yamaha SK-20, all real time recording to a Teac four-track reel-to-reel. I mixed the four tracks to a Teac A-7300 Master 2-Track tape recorder using a DeltaLab DL-2 to create the delay track. In 2006, I used a Tascam 34B 4-track to remaster all my master tapes to digital master of 196 KHz/24 bit .WAV files using Soundforge 8 software. The original Wizards LP was published in the Summer of 1982 with the black and white cover. The initial tracks had no names and were called Movements I-V.

Rival groups will be disappointed to learn that the record is a further experiment in combining hyper melodic pop music with sonic violence. Officials have confirmed that the album contains a record number of hooks, traces of nut and elements of jangle pop, British hardcore punk, atonal music, screaming and drone organs. Yet they have issued warnings of ''a marriage of radical politics with peanut butter spread.'' One authorized statement reads: ''Weighing in at a concise 25 minutes, the album hurtles through its ten songs, each one a succinct, powerful gem.'' Like their debut ''Weird Sister,'' the new album was recorded by MJ from Hookworms, with the aim of heightening the group's ''pop'' and ''aggressive'' elements to excessive and hitherto unrecorded levels. The record has also seen the group explore new and potentially dangerous lyrical territory. Under media interrogation, guitarist George Nicholls confesses to the themes of the record: ''It's about radical politics, fancying people and espionage. The first record was more about violence and revenge fantasy, whereas this one is more about peanut butter.'' Comprised of Alanna McArdle (vocals), Owen Williams (guitar), Max Warren (bass), George Nicholls (guitar & organ) and David Sandford (drums), the band members originally met on a wine tasting holiday. Their debut album ''Weird Sister'' took the world by storm when it was released in September 2013, and went on to win the 2014 Welsh Music Prize. Overwhelming press support saw glowing, hysterical reviews across the board with particular interest from media outlets Pitchfork and the NME. Since the release of ''Weird Sister'' the band have been constantly badgered, surfacing from hiding in order to release split singles with Bristol's Trust Fund and New York's Perfect Pussy, as well as touring with Los Campesinos!, Speedy Ortiz and Stephen Malkmus.""]"

In for a Penny, In for a Pound, which Threadgill calls an 'epic', includes four main movements written specifically to feature each of the musicians in the band. His compositions create a platform that encourages each musician to improvise with an ear for counterpoint and, in the process, creating striking new harmonies.

Press reviews acclaim the Israeli artists for their consummate technical mastery, highly versatile and nuanced playing and exceptional sensitivity. Silver and Garburg capture the playful character of the piano writing, the interplay of impulse and intensity. Nor is this superficial showmanship or mechanical interaction; rather it is an organic and natural blending of the voices and a profound understanding of the work that determines the performance of the two exponents. With their new recording of two highly virtuosic works by Igor Stravinsky, Le sacre du printemps and Petrushka, the two artists have met a formidable challenge. Stravinsky, who arranged this ballet music both for orchestra and for four hands, makes great demands of his pianists. In particular, their interpretation must always stand comparison with the orchestral version. Nor is that all. Stravinskys works make the utmost demands of the instrument and of the artist: rich in contrast and colour, rhythmically vivid and complex, his music demands power and highly nuanced playing concentrated into a small area. This is a task that the pianist pair tackle with remarkable mastery. They unlock from the piano the timbres of an orchestra and the rhythms of a percussion kit and do it in a way that creates the impression only one person is playing. Silver-Garburg were well on the way to promising solo careers when they paired up first privately and then at the piano. They relish the constant contrast between recitals as a duo and orchestral concerts, between intimate pieces that call upon them as a unity, works conceived as dialogue, and those in which they sit at two pianos and summon up the massed power of a full orchestra. Its easy for a piano duo to create effects with sheer virtuosity. But we find that far too little. We want the listeners to be touched by our music to the depths of their heart.']"

Our anthology incorporates the various overlapping strands of the underground folk scene: the acid folk experimenters, the folklorists and trad song updaters, the more metaphysical element of the burgeoning singer/songwriter genre, the newly-electric folk rockers, the elemental paganism exemplified by Comus and The Wicker Man, even the early 1970s Jesus music movement that spawned the likes of the sitar-wielding Parchment. Balancing the familiar with the obscure, we feature acknowledged brand leaders like Fairport Convention, The Incredible String Band, Pentangle and Steeleye Span alongside acts who made music purely for the local communities that nurtured them: Shide & Acorn on the Isle of Wight, Folkal Point in Bristol, Music Box in Coventry, Chrissie Quayle in Cornwall. We incorporate a large number of recordings that weren't issued at the time, sample impossibly rare albums by the likes of Oberon, Dry Heart and Benjamin Delaney Lion, and feature key recordings from a number of bands who underpinned the thriving live scene of the era. Housed in a clambox featuring a lavishly illustrated and annotated 36-page booklet, the painstakingly-assembled Dust On The Nettles is surely the most comprehensive and wide-ranging anthology to appear thus far of the UK underground hippie folk movement of the late 1960s/early 1970s.""]"

Couldnt really figure out a way to sequence the orchestral version within the record, so I decided to carve it up as a book-ending motif, with the rock version squarely in the middle. Mr. Bejar has long displayed a chameleonic instinct for change while maintaining a unified aesthetic (rather than just pinballing between reference points). No two records sound the same, but theyre always uniquely Destroyer. His latest incarnation often appears to take sonic cues from a distinctly British (usually Scottish, to be precise) strain of sophisti-pop: you might hear traces of Aztec Camera, Prefab Sprout, Orange Juice, or The Blow Monkeys.

He used an existing vocabulary, but in so highly idiosyncratic a manner that no attempt to imitate it can succeed. Indeed, as Vaughan Williams put it in a ninetieth birthday BBC tribute that I remember hearing, he had the capacity to make a C major chord sound entirely new. Take, for example, the D minor-cum-modal cadence that ends the Sixth Symphony or the haunting B minor chords that end Tapiola. They sound like no other composer. In his constant renewal of his musical material, Sibelius almost prompts an astronomical analogy; that of continuous creation . Professor Gerald Abraham spoke of the first movement of the Third Symphony as comparable only with the greatest Viennese masters in its mastery of form. Indeed, it is his feeling for form and proportion that never fails to astonish. Yet what Sibelius has to say is intimately related to the atmosphere and sensibility of northern Europe just as, say, Mussorgsky relates to the Russian ethos. And in these deep roots in his native environment lies his strength.<br>When Sibelius was born in 1865, Finland was a provincial backwater of the Tsarist empire and his birthplace a garrison town for its army. There was no permanent symphony orchestra and no opera house. When he died ninety-one years later, Finland was an independent country on the threshold of prosperity after having been drawn into two world wars, its national identity closely defined by Sibelius s own achievements, with fine orchestras in Helsinki and Turku (bo) and the foundations laid for a flourishing opera. Sibelius had become widely celebrated and renowned, Finland s voice in the world. Among twentieth-century masters, the quietism of the Sixth Symphony or the profoundly searching anguish of Tapiola has no real parallel. <br>Robert Layton']"

B00YSOSQ7I,A1A3485UTN4SS,1,1446854400,Rough Guide to Psychedelic Cumbia,VARIOUS,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Latin Music', 'Latin Pop']","['Psychedelic is a buzzword being used a lot these days, especially to sell evermore obscure treasures dug up from the worlds once lost, now rediscovered, international musical archives. In some instances calling the music psych is a bit of a stretch  just because its weird or dressed up in imported trappings from the same era does not make it necessarily so  and at other times it seems to be merely cashing in on a trend. Happily this is not generally the case when applied to cumbia, because this venerable genre of Colombian music with an international reach truly did go through a psychedelic period. Especially in Peru, where it is also experiencing a genuine resurgence of interest among contemporary musicians and audiences alike, from South America to the United States, Europe and beyond. Psychedelic rock (especially the Latin-flavoured kind, as practiced by Santana, Malo, Azteca and the like) and cumbia came of age together in the mid to late 1960s under parallel circumstances. In Peru (and to a lesser extent Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia) the tools of rock and roll  namely electric guitar and organ  were already quite popular among the youth of the day and it makes perfect sense that this originally acoustic Afro-Colombian coastal social dance music would be reborn under the influence of psychedelic culture by the late 1960s, in order to make it relevant to the younger generation. Add to that the strong surf culture in places like coastal Peru and Mexico and conditions were ripe for just the sort of experimentation sampled here. In addition it can be said that imported hippie culture and rock and roll were seen as a real threat to order and decency by dictatorships from Brazil to Cuba. So when many Latin American governments decided to repress the rock and roll rebellion and psychedelic youth culture swirling around them, some of that vibe and energy was sublimated and folded into more marginalised and nationalistically acceptable tropical musical formats like samba, cumbia or salsa. Peru has had its share of great electric guitarists bending strings to the rolling beats of cumbia  from Enrique Delgado to Jos Luis Carballo  who came from its own important domestic tradition of criollo guitar music as much as rock). So its not an exaggeration to say cumbia peruana (and regional variants at times referred to as cumbia andina, cumbia selvtica, and more recently chicha) has had the lions share of Carlos Santana influences evident in the mix. For this reason we start the compilation with a suite of five vintage Peruvian recordings from some of the greats like Juaneco y su Combo. Interestingly the Peruvian psych sound so prevalent in the early 1970s had a profound effect on the originators of cumbia; hence we offer the two fine examples from 1970s Colombia that follow. We round out the mix with a gaggle of contemporary artists from Chile, Mexico, USA, Peru, Colombia, Argentina, and Germany, bringing the psychedelic tropical vibe up to date while still retaining the trippy trappings of yesteryear.']"
B00YUA4XPY,ALQ12GYW884EJ,1,1449014400,2081,John Taylor,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Jazz']","[""'A family project' is how Alex Taylor, singer-songwriter as well as John s son, labels the English pianist s latest album. A project made all the more poignant by the shocking news of John Taylor's death, in July, aged 72. And that is exactly what it is, considering that John, who wrote the music, and Alex, who wrote and sang the lyrics, are joined by Leo Taylor on drums. Oren Marshall on tuba, whose surname is not Taylor but who is most assuredly very close to the Taylor family, completes the quartet. '2081' draws inspiration from Kurt Vonnegut s short story 'Harrison Bergeron', published in 1961. John Taylor was commissioned to write the music by BBC Radio 3 for the Cheltenham Jazz Festival. Originally written for octet, it was then readapted for quartet. Alex Taylor explains: 'Vonnegut s story depicts a dystopian future in which everyone is equal. Nobody is allowed to be smarter, better looking or more physically able than anyone else. Those individuals who are gifted with intellect, talent and so on are made to bear handicaps '. At times, John Taylor s musical realm is reassuring and consistent with his own standards, while, at other times, it conveys the mysterious, unsettling future depicted by Vonnegut, by pursuing a hybrid sound, mingling jazz, pop and a moody soundtrack vibe. This pursuit definitely benefits from the sonic scenarios opened by Marshall s tuba, as well as the drumming style of Leo Taylor (already launched on a brilliant career on the indie-rock scene with his band The Invisible), who very often introduces modern, offbeat hypnotic rhythms here.""]"

The sound of the record puts Max and Lizzy up front, magnifying their disparate, complementary backgrounds, bringing them out of the surreal, shadowy atmosphere of their early releases. In the dynamism in the album's melodies you can hear the way that Lizzy, born and raised in the UK, still has the midnight energy of the London indie pop scene in her veins; there's a plurality and energy to her vocal lines that invokes her work developing other artists as the co-founder of the boutique pop label Neon Gold. There's a sense of brazen forward movement and physicality that suffuses every song, telling of Max's adolescence in Latin America, of the band he started at Vassar, of his time as a choreographer and dance student at Martha Graham Dance Company.""]"

In making the album, composer and multi-instrumentalist Keith Kenniff (the sole artist behind Helios) has created a warm sonic tapestry from luminous guitar lines, elegant piano work, ingeniously-crafted rhythms, and lo-fi electronic elements. Though Kenniff\'s graceful maneuvering of mood and tone lends Yume a journey-like quality, the album offers pieces as captivatingly disparate as ""Pearls"" (which blends heavy beats and lilting piano melodies; cascading guitar riffs and airy atmospherics) and ""Embrace"" (which closes out the album with a glimmering expanse of sound). Built from both electronic experimentation and live instrumentation, Yume also constructs its richly-detailed textures by drawing from a repertoire of sound that ranges from toy tambourines to serendipitously-recorded environmental noises. Raised in rural Pennsylvania, Kenniff put out Helios\'s 2004 debut album Unomia while studying percussion at Boston\'s Berklee College of Music. Since then, he\'s released five more albums as Helios, in addition to collaborating with his wife Hollie Kenniff in the shoegaze-inspired pop duo Mint Julep and composing music for such clients as Paramount Pictures, Apple, Facebook, and Google.

Julia Kent rose to prominence with Rasputina and Antony & The Johnsons. Her extensive rsum includes recent work with Swans, Aidan Baker, Rachel Grimes, Rutger Zuydervelt, Barbara Morgenstern, Library Tapes and Khan of Finland. As the title suggests, this is a record born of conflict: internal, personal and global. Universal themes. The build of pressure and the threat of violent release. Modern guilt. Modern fears. Kent draws from a rich well of emotion, the pieces deceptively rendered, each feeling like a miniature dramatic epic in its own right-sculpted and self-contained. Her work on recent film scores is very much in evidence. While cinematic in scope, there is no trite Hollywood ending here. There is tension and darkness, the edges cracked and frayed. Asperities was recorded, produced and mixed in its entirety by the artist in her New York studio. Looped cello, electronics and found sounds create a world where the technological and the organic merge in perfect symbiosis, the layers of sound peeling back to reveal a beating, bloody human heart at its center.

Over the course of his four-decade career, Castro has played thousands of shows to hundreds of thousands of fans, packing dance floors, always leaving them screaming for more. He and his band, The Painkillers (currently featuring bassist Randy McDonald, keyboardist Michael Emerson and drummer Bowen Brown), play music that is guaranteed to fire up fans and with Method To My Madness (available now on CD and 180 gram blue translucent vinyl, the group turns the intensity up another notch. My main objective when making a new album, says Castro, is to do something different from before. Ive always been a blues guy; its what Im meant to do. But Im always listening and reacting to whats going on in the outside world, experimenting with my guitar tone and my songwriting approach to constantly keep my music fresh. In the end, though, my brand is on every song. Method To My Madness finds Tommy Castro And The Painkillers at their very best. It is instantly a career-defining highlight in a lifetime full of them. From the opening one-two punch of everyman anthems Common Ground and Shine A Light to the full-tilt energy of the title track to the searing, deep soul ballad Died And Gone To Heaven, Tommy and the band are firing on all cylinders. From the bayou rock of Got A Lot and the atmospheric, autobiographical Ride to the reinvented version of the Clarence Carter hit Im Qualified and the emotional cover of B.B. Kings Bad Luck, Tommy Castro And The Painkillers continue to break new ground while simultaneously having an incredible amount of fun. After spending his 20s gigging around in a variety of San Francisco-area blues and soul bands, Castro joined Warner Brothers artists The Dynatones in the late 1980s before forming The Tommy Castro Band in 1991. He released his debut album in 1996 on Blind Pig and hit the road hard, picking up new fans everywhere he went. In the mid-1990s The Tommy Castro Band served as the house band for three seasons on NBC Televisions Comedy Showcase (airing right after Saturday Night Live), bringing him in front of millions of viewers every week. During the 1990s and into the 2000s, Castro released a series of critically acclaimed CDs for Blind Pig, Telarc and 33rd Street Records, as well as one on his own Heart And Soul label. Castro joined Alligator Records in 2009, releasing Hard Believer and winning four of his six career Blues Music Awards including the coveted B.B. King Entertainer Of The Year Award (the very highest award a blues performer can receive). His song Hard Believer took first place in the blues category of the International Songwriting Competition. Castro formed The Painkillers in 2012, creating a lean, mean four-piece lineup and leaving his tight horn section behind. Fueled by Tommys voice and guitar plus bass, drums and keyboards, the band released The Devil You Know in 2014, winning over hordes of new fans. Castro stripped his music down to its raw essence with the band hammering their point home on the bandstand. Jambands declared, Tommy Castro And The Painkillers are a crackling, stripped-down band with plenty of grit and a rocking soul. Now, with Method To My Madness, Tommy Castro And The Painkillers are ready to unleash their new songs on music fans everywhere. With the new album, Castro says, I was trying to get back to my basic ingredients: blues and soul. I went for the energy of connecting with my band. We kept everything raw, capturing the feeling of playing live. Im not about being perfect, he says, summing up. Im about being real. Clearly that is the method to his madness.']"

Each, strictly speaking, was eponymously titled, and each was collected from a series of contemporary four-track, seven-inch, picture-sleeve EPs pop music s main format in France, known as le super 45. In them, we see the maturing of one of the decade s most singular talents a pop singer with the heart of a chanteuse, a singer-songwriter in an age before such a thing was known, and a style icon who valued privacy and modesty. Remastered from the original tapes, we present the first five Franoise Hardy albums in their original French format, on deluxe LP and CD. By 1965, Franoise Hardy was truly international. She d hung out with The Beatles and The Stones, played high-profile shows in London, established a working relationship with British producer Charles Blackwell, and appeared in the film What's New Pussycat? She was also a fashion icon seen in the pages of Marie Claire and Vogue and on the cover of Elle, and her first US album was issued that year. In France, Hardy was to release album number four, the second album to be recorded in London, where her celebrity was rapidly growing at odds with her natural shyness. In London, it was the first time I d been made to think I had a certain charm or charisma, she says now. Thanks to the time in England, I became aware I could be seductive. L Amiti, with its evocative, close-up album cover and late-night sound, is the result. Produced by Jacques Wolfsohn alongside arranger Charles Blackwell, the sessions were notable for some distracting visitors. Mick Jagger was there a few times with various entourages of his at Pye [Studios], recalls Blackwell. There was a long seat in front of the mixing desk where they used to sit. Hardy was, however, not the epitome of the swinging 60s idyll; she was an intellectual, into yoga and Buddhism and astrology, and she still noted French chanson singers George Brassens and Jacques Brel as favorites alongside Elvis, Dionne Warwick, and The Rolling Stones. Despite her new links to the world of fashion, the tentative steps into film, the growing international awareness, and the attention she brought sheerly through her presence, music remained Franoise's focus, and her fourth album more than demonstrated this. A mix of Hardy s own songs, Blackwell s songs, and tracks from writers including Jean-Max Rivire and Grard Bourgeois (who wrote the title track), the sound focused on stirring, heavy pop, not least in the yearning &#34;L Amiti.&#34; I m still very proud of L Amiti, says Franoise, who s wont to undervalue her own work.

Remastered from the original tapes, we present the first five Franoise Hardy albums in their original French format, on deluxe LP and CD. Following the French success of 1962 s Tous Les Garons Et Les Filles and 1963 s Le Premier Bonheur Du Jour, 1964 was the year Hardy went truly international. Having competed in the Eurovision Song Contest and acted in a Roger Vadim film, this was the year Dylan dedicated a poem to her on the sleeve of Another Side and the year she ventured to Britain to record English language songs for the first time. Hardy s first three French EPs of the year, from which just &#34;Pourtant Tu M aimes&#34; appears on Mon Amie La Rose, were largely recorded on home soil with Paris-based arranger Mickey Baker. After the third, Franoise changed tack, abandoned French studios and arrangers, and headed to London s Pye Studios. She would not record again in France until 1968, instead employing a series of British producers and musicians that even included then-studio guitarist Jimmy Page. It was very difficult for me to convince my record company to go to London for the production because my artistic director was having lots of success with very bad arrangements, she says dryly. Since they were having success with bad arrangements, they could continue like that. Hardy got her way and, working with arranger Charles Blackwell, a former protg of Joe Meek, set about creating a new interpretation of her glacial, existentially yearning music: part pop, part chanson, part soul music. On one hand, she was marrying yearning melodies with lyrics examining feelings of otherness. On the other, she was interpreting the music coming from Britain and America both that of Phil Spector and country, too. Blackwell was the first arranger with whom Hardy was happy, and Mon Amie La Rose was the first album she thought of as more than an afterthought. She chose her own songs and was very in control, says Blackwell. She was very much a perfectionist. As Hardy s sound was changing, so was her life; the British were enchanted by her Parisian style and sophistication and didn t see her as the shy, sad soul that those at home painted her as. A new era was beginning, and Hardy s music was traveling further than ever.']"

On this recording Jeroen van Veen used two grand pianos, 3 electronic keyboards, clavichord, 4 synthesizers, and several other instruments, recording the layers one by one. Another fascinating issue by Jeroen van Veen, Dutch champion of Minimal Music. His earlier issue (Paert, Glass, Einaudi, Satie, Minimalists) are worldwide bestsellers! From 'the man who records faster than his shadow' a multitracked version of Terry Riley's toolkit of minimalism, recorded over just two days by Jeroen van Veen on piano and a variety of electronic keyboards. The layers were then edited and superimposed to create the particular, hypnotic quality of the piece's development. The booklet back of this release usefully reprints the individual elements of In C. It is largely left up to the performer(s) to pull these elements together in a satisfying whole, and so each recording is different. Neither does Riley specify which instruments need be used, but the figurations ideally suit a keyboard. In its way the work is as representative of the age of avant-garde freedom as similarly open scores by Stockhausen, except that Riley works exclusively within the white notes of the piano that make up the C major scale. C major is often perceived as the most pure tonality of the diatonic system, and In C certainly passes across the listener's consciousness like white clouds in a brilliant blue summer sky. Jeroen van Veen has won acclaim for his many Brilliant Classics recordings of minimalism, including his own music, but also the piano oeuvres of Philip Glass, Arvo Paert and Ludovico Einaudi: a testament both to the variety of styles to be found under the minimalist umbrella but also to van Veen's ready mastery of those styles. There are many recordings of In C, but almost none at budget price: this release is sure to receive wide critical and popular attention.""]"

INDIE 500 features an All Star supporting cast, including Problem, Slug (of Atmosphere), Rapsody, Pharaoh Monch, Brother Ali, Hi-Tek, NIKO IS and more. After exploding on to the scene as one half of the legendary Black Star alongside Mos Def in 1998, Talib Kweli quickly followed up in 2000 with the album Train of Thought, his collaborative effort with producer Hi-Tek. As fans,critics and his peers unanimously agreed, Kweli was cemented as one of hip hop's top lyricists and continued to release one acclaimed album after another - garnering direct praise from Jay-Z on his song &#34;Moment of Clarity&#34; from Jay-Z's classic The Black Album. Meanwhile as the early 2000's progressed, a new trio was bursting on the scene from North Carolina known as Little Brother. Behind the boards of this trio was producer 9th Wonder, who very quickly established himself as one of hip hop's best producers. As their 2003 album The Listening reached a fever pitch, 9th Wonder's buzz became so hot he claimed a highly coveted production spot as well on Jay-Z's The Black Album. Through the years both Talib Kweli and 9th Wonder have gone on to work with a staggering list of hip hop royalty. However both of their respective works outside of the recording booth have become prominent pieces of their stories as well. 9th Wonder has established himself as Hip Hop's top educator, working as a professor at Harvard, Duke and North Carolina Central University, while Talib Kweli has become one of Hip Hop's most vocal and respected voices, who appears regularly on news outlets such as CNN and programs like HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher. A collaboration between Kweli and 9th almost seemed to make perfect sense, but INDIE 500 represents even more to the artists. &#34;I've always been a fan of collectives, like Native Tongues and the Dungeon Family,&#34; explains Kweli. &#34;INDIE 500 is a tribute to the spirit of unity exemplified by some of great hip hop artists that influenced us.&#34; Collectives are nothing new to the two, who have both successfully run their own labels in Blacksmith, Javotti (Kweli) and Jamla (9th Wonder), helping to break a number of popular artists over the years""]"

Other standout tracks are the beautiful 'One Day' and 'Gilli Men', both resplendent with glistening guitars, velvet-sounding tom-toms, soft strings and Baaba Maal's voice gently echoing against a backdrop of rapturous, layered backing vocals, which tell us to both 'Pursue your own excellence,' and 'Feed your soul'.

And it s not much of a contest. Born Curtis Ousley in Fort Worth, Texas in 1934, the saxophonist played on hundreds of the most hallowed recording sessions of all time, everything from the Coasters Yakety Yak to John Lennon s Imagine album. But Curtis wasn t just a superstar sideman; he also was responsible for some of the greatest Pop/R&B instrumental albums of all time, including such Atco label classics as Live at Small s Paradise, King Curtis Plays the Great Memphis Hits, Instant Groove, and, of course, Live at Fillmore West. Often overshadowed by the brilliance of his session work and his long players, however, is the fact that Curtis was actually quite a successful singles artist, notching 25 Pop and 10 R&B hits during his storied career. And, though it was during his tenure(s) at Atco that he recorded the most popular albums of his career, he also cut a mind-boggling 33 singles (including one that was never released until now) for the label. It is this hitherto-untapped treasure trove that Real Gone Music s KING CURTIS: The Complete Atco Singles presents on three CDs in this unprecedented collection. Not only is this the first time on CD for virtually all of these original mono single mixes, but among these 66 tracks are over two dozen sides that never appeared on LP! That s right...even if you own every Atco album King Curtis put out, you have never heard over a third of this set unless you bought all of the original 45s back in the day. And the caliber of the musicianship? Well, as the most in-demand session man in America, Curtis got to know a lot of folks, so appearing on these sessions are the great Muscle Shoals and Memphis studio cats like Cornell Dupree, Jimmy Johnson, Spooner Oldham, Roger Hawkins, Tommy Cogbill, and Reggie Young, plus a few other folks you might have heard of, like Duane Allman, Eric Clapton, and Delaney Bramlett! Not to mention the alternately tender, searing, and soaring sax lines of Mr. Curtis himself, heard on such classic tracks as Memphis Soul Stew, Ode to Billie Joe, and Whole Lotta Love (yes, the Led Zeppelin song) cheek-by-jowl with a host of smokin rare B-sides. Leiber & Stoller Music Publishing head honcho Randy Poe supplies the liner notes (Leiber and Stoller, of course, had a long relationship with Curtis), which we ve put inside a gleaming 8-panel digipak sporting some great photos and Atco single labels. All but two of the 66 tracks have been transferred from tape in the Warner/Atlantic archives, and Mike Milchner of SonicVision provides the meticulous remastering.

These clear and precise observations by Arnold Cooke (1906-2005) are indicative of a practical approach to his craft. During a long creative life he abstained discreetly from a battery of stylistic trends, including serialism, aleatoricism, minimalism, musique concrte and electronic music, and established single-mindedly a substantial canon notable for its unfaltering cogency and integrity. In his review of the BBC broadcast of Cookes Symphony no.4, Meirion Bowen commented that, The format is entirely that of the traditional four-movement symphony crystal clear to follow, perfectly proportioned in the best academic traditions. The score has a certain Brucknerian grandeur and it is a tribute to the closely-argued intensity of Cookes writing that he achieves this feeling of thematic opulence in a work which is roughly half the time span of an average Bruckner symphony.']"

Unconcerned by the vagaries of musical fashion, he proceeded to build an impressive body of work in his highly expressive, urbane and freely atonal language. His catalogue, which exceeds 160 pieces in total, encompasses all the main genres with the exception of staged opera. The Vision of Judgement was first performed on 13 October 1958 at Leeds Town Hall as part of the Leeds Centenary Festival. The performance presented here is conducted by Charles Groves, who was familiar with the Fricker style, having taken up the composers First Symphony and performed it in one of his last concerts as conductor of the BBC Northern Orchestra and then introduced it in Bournemouth and on the Continent. Dedicated to the many fine musicians with whom I have had the pleasure of working so happily in the Royal Festival Hall, Frickers Symphony No.5 was premiered by organist Gillian Weir with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Colin Davis on 5 May 1976 at the RFH in the presence of the composer. It was featured at the Proms on 11th August 1976 with the organist Jennifer Bate and the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra under John Pritchard. Terse and direct, the score offers some grand gestures in its lively outer sections which are offset by eloquent dialogues between its two principal protagonists in the interludial central segment. Considerable tension is generated in the closing pages, which present an unbuttoned, euphoric display of bravura.']"

Featuring a plethora of big name contributors including Oscar Pettiford, Philly Joe Jones and Gigi Gryce, this landmark work also included guitarist Joe Puma in its line up, a musician who had featured on many of Mann s previous records. 1957 also saw the release of one of Herbie s most curious LPs, Mann Alone, remembered primarily as a solo jazz flute record and previously available only on vinyl. Other notable releases from the period include the classic Yardbird Suite, featuring Mann s interpretation of Charlie Parker s bebop standard, and Flute Fraternity, which saw him collaborate with the legendary Buddy Collette. Demonstrating the musical dexterity of the pair, the album would feature both Mann and Collette playing flute, various saxophones and clarinet. Just Wailin boasted the talents of saxophonist Charlie Rouse, pianist Mal Waldron, guitarist Kenny Burrell, bassist George Joyner and drummer Art Taylor. In December of 1958, Mann had the honour of recording several sessions with the great jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, which would later appear on Chet Baker Introduces Johnny Pace and Chet. 1957 and 1958 marked a true turning point in the career of Herbie Mann as he began to abandon the straight-edge cool jazz style for which he had become best known, and increasingly take influence from outside his traditional fare. This collection, featuring eight original Herbie Mann albums, all now in fully remastered format and providing over five hours of music across four CDs, documents perfectly the beginnings of this master musicians most transitional and challenging period, as it highlights the great man s ability to adopt increasingly experimental forms in a surprisingly subtle manner.']"
B01ARYG0Z2,A36L3NRW858ROT,1,1522886400,Complete Recordings: 1955-1957 SET,Herbie Mann,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Jazz']","['A true pioneer of his instrument - indeed his predecessors were few and far between - Herbie Mann was one of the first to take the flute into the mainstream jazz spotlight. Embracing elements of numerous genres throughout his long and decorated career, Mann was lauded for his intricate playing and impeccable sense of groove that would influence generations of flautists to follow. Born Herbert Jay Solomon in Brooklyn, New York on 16th April 1930, Mann became enamoured with music at an early age, initially wishing to learn drums but eventually being convinced by a family member to take up clarinet instead. His parents, both of Eastern European descent, were dancers and singers before becoming vocal coaches later on in life. Mann attended Lincoln High School in Brighton Beach, and gave his first ever performance at a resort in the Catskills aged 15. After serving four years in the army including time stationed in Trieste, Italy, where he had played saxophone in the military band, Mann returned to the United States in 1952, only to find the Lester Young-derived style he had adopted now oversaturated the music scene. Fate was on Mann s side however, as he was soon approached by Dutch accordionist Mat Mathews, who was seeking a flautist to appear alongside him on the debut album of the then-unknown jazz vocalist Carmen McRae. These sessions would later be released as Carmen McRae (Bethlehem, 1954), and would enable Mann to distinguish himself as one of the first and most groundbreaking jazz flautists. In December of that year he would also appear on Sarah Vaughan with Clifford Brown (EmArcy), an album that would go on to be inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. It was soon after these collaborations that Herbie Mann began taking part in his first studio sessions as bandleader. These would initially be released as the 10 East Coast Jazz/4 (Bethlehem, 1954), and later as a full album with additional recordings as Herbie Mann Plays (Bethlehem, 1956). These sessions also saw the first collaboration of Mann with esteemed jazz guitarist Joe Puma, who would feature on nearly all of Mann s albums over the next four years. Whilst well known for his adoption of different styles as his career progressed, Herbie stayed firmly within the realms of cool jazz during this early period, a direction which received mixed reviews from critics at the time but did little to halt his rising popularity. His proper debut album, Flamingo (Bethlehem 1955) would appear the following year, along with an appearance on The Herbie Mann-Sam Most Quintet (Bethlehem), a collaboration with one of his few flute contemporaries. Mann would also release two highly-regarded albums alongside Belgian flautist and tenor saxophonist Bobby Jaspar: Flute Flight and Flute Souffl (both Prestige, 1957). This four disc collection contains, in their entirety, the recordings that would prove the crucial foundation for this magnificent musician s career. Remastered in excellent quality and featuring nearly five hours of sublime music, this set captures perfectly the striking ability of Herbie Mann during the earliest period of his recording career, and hints at the potential that, when realised, would go on to establish Mann as one of the finest purveyors of his instrument within the world of jazz.']"

His scores are consummately well-crafted and display a rugged individuality. There are no sensational tricks, no compromises to fashion and his is generally a quieter, more contemplative voice than that of his contemporaries. Various influences such as Sibelius, Bartk, Nielsen and, to a lesser extent, Bax and Vaughan Williams may be detected fleetingly in some of his writing, but he went his own way and the best of his music is passionate, tough, direct and sincere. Wordsworths Symphony no.1 (1944) has been broadcast on a couple of occasions, but has not yet received a public performance. The 5th Symphony (1960) is a riot of colour and seemingly unstoppable invention. Representing the composer at the very peak of his powers, it ranks as one of his most life-affirming utterances. In 1957 he wrote, I am quite convinced that I have something to say, and an individual way of saying it which the ordinary music-lover is capable is responding to if he is given sufficient opportunities. I would not go through the labour of creation were I not so convinced.'""]"

The original trio of Conrad Schnitzler, Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius released two seminal albums as Kluster before Roedelius and Moebius replaced the K with a C and continued as a duo. They produced eight albums in their most innovative period between 1971 and 1981, two of them together with another pioneer of electronic music, Brian Eno. Cluster anticipated much of what would later emerge in such varied styles as industrial, ambient, electro and even synthpop. Some call Cluster's music avant-garde, others Krautrock or Kosmische Musik. Few would dispute their immense influence on the music of younger generations, even though commercial success largely eluded them. Hence their first album, as a microcosm of their entire oeuvre, made the list of 100 Records That Set The World On Fire (While No One Was Listening) in The Wire magazine, the ultimate purveyor of good taste. The box set contains all eight of the regular LPs which represent their main phase, plus a previously unreleased album of two live recordings from the years 1972 and 1977.

His latest release: 'Old Locks and Irregular Verbs' features the seven piece Ensemble Double Up, the first new group of Threadgill's to record in 15 years. He conducts the ensemble, which features a surprising combination of the acclaimed pianists Jason Moran and David Virelles, along with tuba, cello, two saxophones, and drums. The work is Threadgill's tribute to his friend, the composer-conductor Lawrence D. Butch Morris, who passed away in 2013. A significant composer from the jazz avant-garde, Morris was responsible for creating a distinctive form of improvised conducting of large-ensembles which he called 'conduction'. Threadgill describes it as 'an emotion, a thought. A feeling that I retained in my memory of him.' The piece contains many of the hallmarks of Threadgill's signature sound: angular polyrhythmic grooves, slippery counterpoint and wide-open harmonic possibilities before turning into an elegy and building to a fanfare-like crescendo and abrupt end, a fitting and final homage.""]"

THE BEASTMASTER tells the story of Dar, a valiant warrior who can telepathically communicate with animals. Dar (Singer) is a stolen son of royalty, kidnapped from the queen s womb by a witch in service to Maax (Torn), an evil sorcerer. Dar is saved from sacrifice by a kind villager, who raises him and teaches the young prince how to fight and utilize his uncanny ability to commune with animals. Facing life alone after his village and its people are destroyed by Jun warriors in league with Maax, Dar rescues a slave girl (Roberts) and pairs up with boy prince Taj and former King s guard Seth (John Amos), along with his animal companions, to fight against Maax. Released in the US in late August 1982 (three months after CONAN), THE BEASTMASTER managed to overcome a lukewarm box office performance with a strong cult following that generated two sequel movies and a Canadian television series that aired 66 episodes over three seasons in 1999-2002.', 'Previously released on compact disc by Quartet Records in 2013 as a limited edition release that quickly sold out, Dragon s Domain Records is excited to bring THE BEASTMASTER back into the marketplace at the request of the composer, newly remastered by Digital Outland under the composer s supervision. The end result is a rendition of the BEASTMASTER score that most closely matches what Lee had imagined back in 1982.', 'The booklet includes exclusive liner notes written by author Randall Larson with the participation of the composer. Dragon s Domain Records presents THE BEASTMASTER on 2 CDs. Disc 1 opens with the original album program from 1983 followed by the music cues as they appear in the movie in film order, continuing onto Disc 2.']"

Once again, his regular sidemen for the past eight years, bassist Gregg August and drummer Rudy Royston, are back on board. Eight years is a pretty impressive stint for any band to put in together, especially in the jazz world and the ensemble work reflects the familiarity of the players, presenting a series of friendly obstacle courses hinged on spontaneous and collective choice-making. Allen's playing sometimes murmurs, and other times rises to a heartfelt cry, but he never abandons himself to free jazz screaming, or tangles himself up with knuckle-busting ribbons of notes. His phrases have a deep blues feeling, and his compositions are built around concise, memorable melodies which he repeats until they've sunk deep into the listener's memory. But whether he is looking back to the earliest forms of America's home-grown music or pointing the way to its future, JD Allen never fails to challenge and engage the listener as few of his generation can.""]"

Although vintage British psychedelia is viewed by many these days as an Alice In Wonderland-style enchanted garden full of beatific flower children innocently gathering flowers or chasing butterflies, there was always a more visceral element to the scene. Pointedly free of such fripperies as scarlet tunic-wearing gnomes, phenomenal cats and talismanic bicycles, the power trio format that was popularized by the likes of Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience spawned a host of imitators. As the 60s drew to a close and pop evolved slowly but inexorably into rock, psychedelia gave way to a sound that was harder, leaner, heavier, louder. Across three discs and four hours of music, I'm A Freak, Baby: A Journey Through The British Heavy Psych And Hard Rock Underground Scene 1968-72 investigates that largely under-documented period, incorporating everything from some of the biggest names in the burgeoning hard rock/proto-metal firmament (Deep Purple, Uriah Heep) all the way down to a significant number of provincial semi-pro bands who gigged extensively but were unable to land a recording contract during their lifetime. We feature some of British rock's pioneering acts (The Yardbirds, The Move), a handful of bands who travelled far beyond their blues boom roots (Fleetwood Mac, Chicken Shack, The Groundhogs), the infamous Ladbroke Grove scene (The Deviants, The Pink Fairies, Hawkwind, The Edgar Broughton Band), a smattering of inspired, where-the-hell-did-that-come-from one-shots like The Velvet Frogs and the mighty Egor, and a clutch of previously-unreleased recordings (The Kult, Hellmet, The Phoenix) that have even eluded the specialist reissue companies and bootleggers. Housed in a clambox featuring a lavishly illustrated and annotated 36-page booklet, I'm A Freak, Baby is the most comprehensive and wide-ranging anthology to appear thus far of an underground scene that, in addition to being responsible for some magnificent music, also acted as a signpost to the subsequent emergence of British punk and heavy metal.""]"

By the late 60s, the British Guitar Hero was in the ascendency, and blokes like Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Alvin Lee were being deified. Rock Music was growing progressively louder, hair was flowing, trousers were tightening, and guitar solos were getting longer, flashier, more intricate and increasingly self-indulgent. The Axe Man had indeed come a long way since his humble beginnings, just 15 years or so earlier, when either a honking sax or a plinking piano invariably took the lead breaks on a 45rpm record (or in those days, 78rpm), rather than an electric guitar. There had been no British guitar heroes back in the 50s - indeed, there hadn't really been any young guitarists - and the session men who played on those records were either disgruntled jazz or po-faced dance-band musicians. However, guitarists like Hank Marvin, Mick Green, Vick Flick, Big Jim Sullivan, Joe Brown and, of course, Blackmore and Page, were about to change all that as rock music morphed into something far more dangerous by the late 60s.""]"
