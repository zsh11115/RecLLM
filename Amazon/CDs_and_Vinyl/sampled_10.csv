Rather, the live effort is among the most emotionally naked spectacles ever released an album so starkly intense and profoundly personal, it's impossible not to get chills down the spine. The set list is as surprising as the stylistic makeover. Save for renditions of 'All Apologies' and 'Come As You Are', the adventurous material includes brooding covers of the Meat Puppets' 'Lake of Fire', 'Plateau', and 'Oh Me' as well as harrowing versions of David Bowie's 'The Man Who Sold the World', and the Vaselines' 'Jesus Don't Want Me for a Sunbeam'.""]"

Includes their over-the-top smash cover of Summertime Blues .', '""A heavy metal precursor, Blue Cheer were there at the start and became true pioneers. Their cracking debut, Vincebus Eruptum, sounds primordial, even by today\'s standards. Lord knows how it must have gone across in 1968. Though entrenched in blues-rock, the Cheer\'s sheer power broke new boundaries. On this re-issue of the rare, mono mix of the album, the drums retain their chunky presence alongside the thick, stodgy bass. Check out the unlikely hit, Eddie Cochran\'s \'Summertime Blues.\' The same year\'s follow-up, Outsideinside, tried to retain the force but added panache to the production- and it worked. Each member of the band appeared to be better represented, with their individual talents brought to the fore. Clarity doesn\'t replace power, though- the word was that parts of Outsideinside literally had to be recorded outside because they were so loud. Leaving the band (as some claim, due to deafness) just two LP\'s in, co-founder Leigh Stephens subsequently released his debut solo LP. Praised by many, it was slammed by Cheer fans. Moving away from his band\'s energy storm, Red Weather was more psychedelic, and both inventive and creative enough to survive the shift in focus. As a bonus for hardcore name-trackers, it features uber-session bloke Nicky Hopkins, Blossom Toes\' Kevin Westlake and Jeff Beck Band\'s Mick Waller."" -- <i> Record Collector, April 2010</i><br /><br />""Just as the German King Tiger outgunned the allied Sherman in World War II, so California\'s Blue Cheer out-louded their peers with their 1968 debut. These super-dence blues rock tunes owe Hendrix a debt and are prone to powering off Blues Magoos-style, but come in their own special engine oil and LSD marinade (see the surprise Top 20 cover of Summertime Blues). A long-spurned, now essential stop-off on the cakewalk to stoner-rock nirvana. The reissue comes with an embossed sleeve and a poem from Owsley Stanley."" -- <i>Mojo, April 2010</i><br /><br />This being an audiophile \'zine one might expect that the records appearing herein to be judged with sound quality as perhaps not the main focus of the review, but certainly a major factor when considering whether they should be recommended for inclusion in one\'s collection. Well, here we have two albums that despite their lack of just about any evidence of audiophile-approved traits (other than the vinyl\'s modern-day pressing quality and the excellent transfer from original master tapes to vinyl), should be a mandatory purchase for anyone even slightly interested in the conception and gestation of hard rock/psychedelic blues/heavy metal that these landmark albums brought into the world in 1968. These two Marshall-stack-laden slabs are not just forbearers of what would become the genre that is now considered heavy metal, but quintessential examples of excellent rock music, period. <P>Blue Cheer formed in 1966 in their hometown of San Francisco, and within a year settled into a power-trio of unequaled sonic might. Their first album, Vincebus Eruptum was recorded late in 1967 and released early the next year on Philips, and later in \'68 their second album Outsideinside was released. One would think that being located in San Francisco this band would get caught in the torrent of flower-power ideology that was flowing forth in and around the city, but according to Blue Cheer\'s bassist and vocalist Dickie Peterson, ""We were the ugly stepchildren. Everybody in San Francisco scene was all kiss babies and eat flowers. We were sort of kiss flowers and eat babies"". This less than hippy attitude is made obvious as soon as the stylus traces the first grooves of either of these two records. <P>OK, so you\'re not going to be able to use either of these albums as demonstration discs. But it makes little sense depriving oneself just because at certain points these albums sound as if they were recorded from the next room through an open door. It\'s a shame that these records don\'t have the sound quality of say, Led Zeppelin\'s first two albums that were released during the next two years. One might suspect that the less than state-of-the-art facility that Blue Cheer used for the first album in their native San Francisco might have had something to do with the the less than reference quality sound. Yet the follow-up Outsideinside was recorded at some top flight studios on both coasts, and even sported some pretty famous engineering talent including the illustrious Eddie Kramer. Yet this album\'s sound quality is also second-rate. It was most likely due to the challenges of recording a band with all of their amp\'s volume controls set to 11 the entire time. It has been rumored that the band had to relocate to a different studio during one of the recording sessions because of noise complaints from the neighborhood around the facility. Yet despite these sonic limitations, and especially on the mono Vincebus Eruptum, the term ""wall-of-sound"" is very, very apt. And because of these excellent transfers performed by Sundazed Records, the best I\'ve ever heard from any other pressings on both vinyl and CD. An added bonus is that the album sleeves are also top-notch, the embossed front cover of the first and gatefold of the second are exact reproductions of the originals. <P>I have the impression that I\'m hearing exactly what was on the master tapes as they were recorded. I doubt very much that the band and the studio staff set out to make the resulting sound of these albums anything but what they intended, and with these slabs of wax, at least when being played on my system, it is easy to get the impression that the air in and around the recording studio during these sessions became super-saturated with sound waves--and if you\'ve ever experienced an overwhelmingly loud band in a small space you\'d realize that the ""P"" in SPLs (Sound Pressure Levels) can be brutal. <P>It would be a shame to purchase one of these albums without the other. But since the best place to start is usually the beginning, Vincebus Eruptum should be spun first. And the fact that it is a monaural pressing is fabulous, not just because back in those heady days stereophonic sound was still in its infancy with regards to rock music. This is not to say that many great stereo rock records weren\'t released--of course there were. But the the truth is that in most cases they really weren\'t truly ""stereophonic"" as classical releases were, it was simply just two-channel sound. This was at least partially because at most four-track tape used in most recording studios, so during mix down it was just a matter of deciding which and how much of these tracks ended up in which of the two speakers. There are some great rock albums from around the same period that had engineers that realized that a nice stereo spread could be obtained by using a pair of overhead mics for the drum set. But many didn\'t get the memo, and the drums were relegated to one track--and to add insult to injury were panned to one side. The overused practice of pseudo-psychedelic swooping between the speakers, especially the lead guitar hardly makes a record ""stereo"", so things just ended up sounding just like plain old dual-mono. Sundazed Records\' outstanding pressing of the reissue of Vincebus Eruptum from the original mono master tape is practically a revaluation, especially to the ears belonging to yours truly that has only heard the stereo pressing throughout my adult life. The mono version is so much more of an ""in your face"" experience. As it should be. <P>Vincebus contains six songs, half of them are cover tunes. Side one starts with the classic Jerry Capehart/Eddie Cochran ""Summertime Blues"", which was to be Blue Cheer\'s only ""hit"" record (it peaked at #14 on Billboard\'s pop singles chart). Next is the chestnut ""Rock Me Baby"", and the side ends with the now classic Peterson bruiser ""Doctor Please"", with his lyrics taking an anti-recreational drug stance and at the same time proclaiming an unrequited love for a member of the opposite sex, but you have to squint your ears to decipher the lyrics under the guitar/bass/drums blitzkrieg. Side two begins its onslaught with Peterson\'s ""Out Of Focus"", with its overdubbed guitar lick madness that rightfully earned guitarist Leigh Stephens a fervent underground following. Next up is the requisite ""Parchment Farm"", but side two ends with the barnburner that is the Dickie Peterson opus ""Second Time Around"". Thankfully, the concept of a ""power ballad"" never entered the members of Blue Cheer\'s minds, so throughout the album\'s brief thirty-two minute playing time one barely gets the opportunity to come up for air. <P>Outsideinside\'s recording quality is a bit better than Vincebus, but it has little to do with it being a ""stereo"" pressing. Like I said, it was recorded at some noted studios by some renowned engineers but still ends up sounding rather lo-fi. But despite the lack of fidelity the massive sound of the band members in all their glory are still decipherable through one\'s speakers. Over the years I\'ve met legions of fans of this album, and although its sound quality rarely comes into question, what they do agree upon is that it is one of the best hard rock (electric-power-blues?) recordings ever committed to vinyl. Throughout the years I\'ve gone back and forth in regards to whether it is a better album than Vincebus, but eventually realized that that debate is a waste of my time--they both deserve equal time on my turntable. But I do sometimes favor Outsideinside for a few reasons, and major among those is the more concise, developed songwriting made even more amazing that the album was released such a short time since the first. The songs are shorter, leaving less room for extended improvisation, leading to Mr. Stevens\' guitar solos being more focused mini-explosions. And this time eight of of ten songs are original compositions. Immediately upon playing the opening ""Feathers From Your Tree"" one can hear the confidence not only in its writing, but the massive ""whomp"" factor coming into play--thanks in large part to the pounding of drummer Paul Whaley. The third song is Peterson\'s bluesy, flanged, rocking ""Just A Little Bit"", another of the eight originals that compose the ten masterpieces. It\'s worth mentioning again that the purchase of both these albums should be mandatory for all even slightly interested in this period of rock \'n\' roll. -Tom Lyle -- <i>Positive Feedback Online, Issue 49</i>']"

Songwriting credit goes to Jim Steinman on You Took the Words Right out of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night); Heaven Can Wait; All Revved Up with No Place to Go; Two out of Three Ain't Bad; Paradise by the Dashboard Light; For Crying out Loud; Great Boleros of Fire , and the title track."", '<I>Bat Out of Hell</I> is probably remembered most for its rock operetta about every teenage boy\'s plight, ""Paradise by the Dashboard Light."" Certainly the most dramatic piece on the album, it engaged Meat Loaf\'s testosterone-crazed tenor in an incremental game of sexual bargaining with the resistant, but willing, Ellen Foley. By employing exaggerated power chords, screaming vocals, over-the-top arrangements, and a sense of rock & roll as Broadway theater, <I>Bat</I> made Meat Loaf a star. <a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/69862/${0}"">Jim Steinman</a>\'s contribution to the record is invaluable.

Jones and Willie Nelson.Digitally remastered by Chris Athens (Sterling Sound, New York, New York).This is part of Legacy\'s American Milestones series.15 years before Tony Bennett made the Great American Songbook safe for the MTV generation, there was Willie Nelson\'s STARDUST, one of the greatest ""crossover"" albums in history. The concept was simple: Willie singing a select group of familiar standards by composers such as Carmichael, Berlin, Weill, Ellington, the Gershwins, all in his familiar and inimitable style. Yet the result is not a quite a country treatment of these tunes. For one thing, the great R&B organist Booker T. Jones produced the session in addition to performing with Nelson\'s superb band featuring the estimable Mickey Raphael on harmonica. One of the enduring pleasures of STARDUST is the interplay between hushed organ, keening harmonica and Nelson\'s own stately gut-string guitar as well as his beautifully measured, plaintive singing.', ""Willie Nelson has never been one to do the safe or expected, and this Booker T. Jones-produced album of pop standards from the '30s and '40s certainly fits the profile. It's also one of the better albums of Nelson's career, allowing Willie to dip his fragile, quivering tenor all around the beat in songs like &quot;All of Me&quot; and &quot;Unchained Melody.&quot; Jones's organ, piano, and string arrangements are low-key and swinging (except on the almost wooden &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot;), and Nelson's vocals on &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; and &quot;Moonlight in Vermont&quot; are filled with a dignified and slightly jazzy country soul. <I>--David Cantwell</I>""]"

The results, particularly on the tracks &quot;Chameleon&quot; and &quot;Watermelon Man,&quot; had a profound impact on other musicians, although critics charged Hancock with playing to the galleries.

The concept of the 1967 release was very simple, tracing a day in the life from dawn to night, from awakening to sleep. The seven tracks spawned two hit singles--""Tuesday Afternoon"" and ""Nights in White Satin"" (which hit No. 2 four years after the LP\'s original release) and a prog-rock cottage industry. <I>--Bill Holdship</I>']"

Like the indie rockers of yore, he revels in his marginality because of the creative freedom it gives him. His full-length U.S. debut, <i>Selected Ambient Works Volume II</i> (1994), includes some of the most serene sounds this side of the Orb, but his favorite hobby is the not-at-all-blissful pastime of driving a Daimler Ferret Mark 3 tank through his parents' backyard."", ""None of his recordings have captured the competing impulses to lull you to sleep and blast out your eardrums as well as <i>Richard D.

As his adventures with the family upright indicate, James was a bit of a devil even as a child. &quot;Beetles&quot; is the sound of a boy frying bugs on the sidewalk with a magnifying glass, and &quot;To Cure a Weakling Child&quot; shows flashes of the sort of sadism found only on preschool playgrounds. If you still doubt that young Richard developed early on, the romantic Nino Rota-style strings on &quot;Girl/Boy Song&quot; are just made for passionate seductions, and the tune appears in three mixes, each one hot and hornier than the one before."", ""The raucous undercurrents of even his calmest tunes and the sources of many of his most common sounds are what link James to the rock tradition.

Framed by understated jazz and pop arrangements, Cassidy\'s clear, soulful voice and exquisite phrasing make her that rarest of vocalists whose interpretations are a complement to any song.

The piano ripples, the cello sings gorgeously, the violin soars ecstatically, the tone is intoxicatingly beautiful.

Like many a pop singer, Stewart returns here to what's become generally known as the Great American Songbook, that evergreen body of mid-20th century songcraft that continues to inspire singers across oceans and generations. It's said that Stewart has been vocalizing many of these songs in private for years, and given the warm, human scale of most of the performances here, it's not hard to believe. Producer Phil Ramone's spare, unobtrusive arrangements inspire the singer to some of his most subtle and rewarding performances in years. Stewart's slightly weary vocal tack handsomely suggests the smoke, booze, and aching heart that lie at the best of these songs.

Pushing the singer\'s distinctive dry voice to the forefront, and with Harrison\'s trademark slide guitar riffs as sinewy as ever, Lynne\'s showcase production is mostly spot-on and refreshingly restrained, while Dhani brings his own fresh, touchingly personal insights to the record. He double-tracked his own voice onto an old recording of his father chanting the traditional ""Namah Parvati"" and appended it as the album\'s spiritual benediction, a touching reminder that while musicians come and go, music can truly embody their spirit forever. <I>--Jerry McCulley</I>']"

This 20-track anthology obviously can\'t chronicle much more than the hits and high points of Taylor\'s career, but it nonetheless captures the artistic essence of a performer who\'s become a virtual synonym for ""singer-songwriter"" since his emergence in the late \'60s. A lot of ink has been spilled ruminating about Taylor\'s role in soothing a \'60s-burned generation, but given his own well-known demons (depression, addiction) his gentle voice often sounds like the physician wisely healing himself. His muse seems fully formed from the opening ""Something in the Way She Moves,"" a track cut for the <a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/35766/${0}"">Beatles</a>\' Apple label in late 68 (and one that seems to share some symbiotic relationship with <a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/156933/${0}"">George Harrison</a>\'s own classic ""Something"" from the period), its tone at once familiar and inviting--if ripe for a few decades of parody--as it wends its way from his seminal early \'70s hits through a slate of later originals, R&B (""How Sweet It Is,"" ""Handy Man"") and pop (""Up On the Roof"") covers. Tellingly, he delivers those chestnuts with an offhand confidence and illumination that makes them his own, a sense that informs even his jazz and Brazilian (""Only a Dream a Rio"") flirtations. The set\'s newly recorded bonus cut, John Sheldon\'s ""Bittersweet,"" is a pleasant pop confection that showcases Taylor\'s knack for being laconic and upbeat in the same breath. <I>--Jerry McCulley</I>']"

Produced by Rick Rubin, Vol 3 not only captures the bands strengths to this point- it sees the spore that is Slipknot exploding in all directions. The songs on this daring effort transcend traditional hard music structure, and will surprise the uninitiated with their dynamic appeal. Masterful guitar work, visceral drum beats, and a newly-expanded vocal range are highlights of this work that Corey Taylor (#8) calls ""both brutal and beautiful."" Much of the creative inspiration in evidence on the new album is owed to Rubin and his reputedly- haunted mansion, in which the band lived while recording VOL. 3: (THE SUBLIMINAL VERSES). ""You can really feel (the effect of the mansion) on the album. There were ghosts in the machine, in the equipment! . Things would freeze, things would loop for no reason at all. It was strange,"" adds Taylor. Paul Gray (#2) comments on what Rubin brought to the table ""Rick brought a huge amount of open mindedness - normally 9 different people trying different things can be tough - Rick got us to just throw all our preconceived notions out the window. He was able to integrate bits and pieces of everyone\'s ideas."" <P>The first single off VOL. 3: (THE SUBLIMINAL VERSES), ""Duality"" is, ""lyrically, what you might think... we\'ve been through a lot as a band and the lyrics really reflect our maintaining faith and the perseverance of all 9 of us,"" says Joey Jordison (#1). ""Duality"" represents the album well in its unwillingness to compromise the bands rock foundation and its ability to be aurally appealing and melodic at the same time. Other songs of note on the record, ""Before I Forget"" and ""Vermillion"" underline the statement made by ""Duality"", with their dark melodies and fierce instrumentation. ""Before I Forget"" is about rising above the bull*#!t and being a person, not a human. It\'s about saying what you mean and meaning what you say - taking zero bull#!*t."" adds Taylor, ""and Vermillion is a stalker\'s love song, shot thru his eyes. It\'s kind of a does he or doesn\'t he type thing - it\'s left open for you to decide.""', 'If it\'s sometimes a chore to get past Slipknot\'s stratified shock-rock shtick, Iowa\'s nouveau metal-mongers take the occasion of their third album proper to prove there\'s a genuinely restless, undeniable musical juggernaut beneath the horror-show masquerade. Producer Rick Rubin has honed their modern metal assault to a fine edge here, tempering it with a compelling sense of dynamics missing from all too many similar heavy forgings in the bargain. But credit the band with hammering together the solid foundations of what stands as their best album to date, a collection that succeeds by--surprise--reverting to more traditional song-forms and occasionally operating at something other than a relentless fevered pitch. Call it mainstreaming or a newfound maturity; whatever it is, it pays diverse dividends from the opening cinematic tension of ""Prelude 3.0"" and paramilitary-cadenced thrill ride ""Three Nil"" to the moody, rap-thrash single ""Duality"" and the unlikely, angst-laden pop hooks of ""Circle."" If that song\'s cello-inflected atmospherics and lilting Corey Taylor vocals may have the band\'s faithful initially rubbing their ears in puzzlement, by the time the evocative acoustic guitars, bittersweet harmonies and string quartet break of ""Vermilion Pt. 2"" rolls around, it\'s clear this is a band who\'s challenged itself with broad new horizons--and triumphed. <I>--Jerry McCulley</I>']"

And Lynn comparing him to renowned Nashville producer Owen Bradley? Yes, we all know the world is rapidly shrinking, but now we\'ve seen everything. Most stunning of all--they nailed it. For the first time, Lynn has written all of an album\'s songs, and her lyrics are as cutting and incisive as ever. On the powerful, biting ""Family Tree,"" she brings her babies to the home of her husband\'s mistress so that they can see the ""woman that\'s burning down our family tree."" Throughout she cunningly tackles tried-and-true honky-tonk themes of love gone bad, drinkin\', cheatin\', and murder. Lynn even offers a compelling slice of theological fatalism (""God Makes No Mistakes""). White\'s production--mostly stark and atmospheric--ranges from more-traditional country to straight-up <a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/219981/${0}"">White Stripes</a>, with most tracks falling somewhere in between. White duets with Lynn on the rousing one-night-stand story ""Portland, Oregon,"" but he does not need to sing to leave his personal stamp. At 70, Lynn seems thoroughly engaged and delighted; at times she delivers some of the most emotionally potent singing of her career. A decade earlier, <a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/18537/${0}"">Johnny Cash</a> turned to rock and rap producer Rick Rubin, and the move resuscitated Cash\'s career. Now, Jack White has done the same for Loretta Lynn, another country legend whose music is simply too raw and honest for the contemporary country crowd. <I>Van Lear Rose</I> exceeds all expectations--a bold collaboration in which artists from two different musical universes forge a memorable work that neither could have created alone. <I>--Marc Greilsamer</I>']"

""It\'s all so dark and mysterious/When the one you want doesn\'t want you,"" sing the chiseled Lotharios on ""Siberia.""

With the new Back to Basics album, her musical style has changed from the urban and light rock sounds of Stripped to a soulful and jazz-inspired album. Aguilera has described her upcoming album as a soul record combining elements of 1920s, \'30s and \'40s blues and jazz with modern day influences.[2] The album\'s title was confirmed in the March issue of Rolling Stone magazine, and Aguilera was featured in a cover story of ELLE UK magazine confirming her work with producers Mark Ronson and P. Diddy. The record finds her working with hip-hop producers DJ Premier, Kwame and Ronson for the first time. It will also find her working with Linda Perry, who worked with Aguilera on Stripped (2002). In February 2006 at MTV\'s TRL Awards, she previewed three unmastered tracks from the upcoming album including ""Candy Man"" and ""Back to Basics"". Back to Basics is a double-CD.', '<I>Back to Basics</I>, Christina Aguilera\'s first disc in four years, refines and clarifies the--let\'s call it ""sexy""--aura surrounding this platinum firebrand. Here, the best belter in a class that counts Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears on its roll call has turned her attention to love songs: the supercharged and ubiquitous first single ""Ain\'t No Other Man,"" for one, and the hushed stunner ""Save Me from Myself"" for another. That doesn\'t mean she\'s foresworn being nasty, though. Dive deep into this set, past the gorgeous crackle that frames the old-school jazz-, blues-, and soul-inspired tracks on the first disc, and you\'ll reach a playful and familiar raunch; ""Candyman"" celebrates a ""one-stop shop"" who ""makes the panties drop"" to a boogie-woogie beat, and ""Nasty Naughty Boy"" sends out a heated, big-beated invitation to ""sip on my champagne/Cause I\'m gonna give you a little taste/Of the sugar below my waist."" Thoughtful listeners should snap out of their fascination with Xtina\'s undiminished yet newly un-tramp-like sexuality, though, because what they\'ll really want to focus on throughout these 22 tracks is the honest-to-God artistry. While the rock producer Linda Perry helps disc two pop in interesting and unexpected ways (check the muffled blues number ""I Got Trouble"" and ""Mercy on Me,"" an obvious nod to Fiona Apple), DJ Premier, a mainstay on Jay-Z and Nas projects, pipes a batch of aural high-fives into the nostalgia-bitten first disc (the deep-down funk of ""Back in the Day,"" the strut-strut early hip-hop sound of ""Still Dirrty""). Their nudges aside, though, <I>Back to Basics</I> is all Aguilera\'s baby--she executive-produced, and she\'s found herself artistically. Nobody would argue, in fact, if she swiveled around the chorus to ""Ain\'t No Other Man,"" written for her husband, and aimed it at herself: ""You got soul, you got class/You got style, you\'re bada--."" <I>--Tammy La Gorce</I>', '', '<span class=""h1""><strong>More from Xtina</strong></span> <table border=""0 "" cellpadding=""4"" width=""100%"" cellspacing=""4"">', '', '<tr class=""tiny"" align=""center"" valign=""top"">', '<td> <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000JY9M/ref=ed_mus_6x_xtina"">', '<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B00000JY9M.01.SWATCHZZ.jpg"" border="" 0""><br><I>Christina Aguilera</I></a></td>', '', '<td><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006CXXU/ref=ed_mus_6x_xtina"">', '<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B00006CXXU.01.SWATCHZZ.jpg"" border="" 0""><br><I>Stripped</I></a></td>', '', '<td><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004WJDG/ref=ed_mus_6x_xtina"">', '<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B00004WJDG.01.SWATCHZZ.jpg"" border="" 0""><br><I>Mi Reflejo</I></a></td>', '</tr>', '', '<tr class=""tiny"" align=""center"" valign=""top"">', '<td><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004Y7SF/ref=ed_mus_6x_xtina"">', '<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B00004Y7SF.01.SWATCHZZ.jpg"" border="" 0""><br><I>My Kind of Christmas</I></a></td>', '', '<td><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000TWMMA/ref=ed_mus_6x_xtina"">', '<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B0000TWMMA.01.SWATCHZZ.jpg"" border="" 0""><br><I>Christina Aguilera -Stripped-Live in the UK</I></a></td>', '', '<td><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005IA82/ref=ed_mus_6x_xtina"">', '<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B00005IA82.01.SWATCHZZ.jpg"" border="" 0""><br><I>Christina Aguilera-My Reflection</I></a></td>', '</tr>', '</table>', '']"

If, on the other hand, you\'re a late arrival to the Rocket Man\'s repertoire, you\'ll have to adjust your expectations. <I>Kid,</I> unlike more recent efforts, isn\'t aiming itself at the lite-FM listening masses.

The music, a choir-enhanced swerve through genres including pop, rock, blues, folk, and country with signature piano riffs thrown in nearly everywhere, chronicles their splintery relationship. Innocence and hope (""Postcards from Richard Nixon"") give way to success and joy (""Just Like Noah\'s Ark""), which eventually leads to discontent (""Tinderbox"") and disaster (""And the House Fell Down""). A shot at redemption (""The Bridge"") later finds the Captain; reflection (""Old 67"") and a joyous reunion (the title track) follow.', 'Theirs is ultimately a simple story, but John and Taupin suffuse it with hypnotic sentimentality--along with the narrative, echoes of past hits wander into several classic-sounding tracks. ""Tiny Dancer"" darts through the cracked-voice beauty of ""Blues Never Fade Away"" and ""The Bridge,"" for example, while ""Wouldn\'t HaveYou Any Other Way (NYC)"" works in hints at both ""Candle in the Wind"" and ""Where to Now St. Peter."" Other songs shake loose less likely influences (""I Must Have Lost it on the Wind"" sounds like something off a vintage Linda Ronstadt album), but all are compellingly steeped in context; if you don\'t get the late-disc reference to fine silk suits and six-inch heels, you\'ll wish you did. <I>--Tammy La Gorce</i>', '<span class=""h1""><strong>Selected Favorites from Elton John</strong></span> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""4"" width=""100%"" cellspacing=""4"">', '', '<tr class=""tiny"" align=""center"" valign=""top"">', '<td> <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001EG4/ref=ed_mus_6x_elton"">', '<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B000001EG4.01.TXXXXXXX.jpg"" border="" 0""><br><I>Tumbleweed Connection</I></a></td>', '', '<td><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001EGC/ref=ed_mus_6x_elton"">', '<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B000001EGC.01.TXXXXXXX.jpg"" border="" 0""><br><I>Madman Across the Water</I></a></td>', '', '<td><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001DQI/ref=ed_mus_6x_elton"">', '<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B000001DQI.01.TXXXXXXX.jpg"" border="" 0""><br><I>Goodbye Yellow Brick Road</I></a></td>', '</tr>', '', '<tr class=""tiny"" align=""center"" valign=""top"">', '<td><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001EGE/ref=ed_mus_6x_eltont"">', '<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B000001EGE.01.TXXXXXXX.jpg"" border="" 0""><br><I>Honky Chateau</I></a></td>', '', '<td><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001EGA/ref=ed_mus_6x_elton"">', '<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B000001EGA.01.TXXXXXXX.jpg"" border="" 0""><br><I>Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy</I></a></td>', '', '<td><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006RAKP/ref=ed_mus_6x_elton"">', '<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B00006RAKP.01.TXXXXXXX.jpg"" border="" 0""><br><I>Greatest Hits 1970-2002</I> (Box Set)</a></td>', '</tr>', '</table>', '']"

Chris' track 'Wanted Dead Or Alive' is the most downloaded track from the America Idol Season 5 encores album with more that 100,000 downloads and still counting.

That it translates so well to a solo disc (<I>Daughtry</I> was recorded with studio musicians; future discs will include a Daughtry-assembled band) proves all he needed was a little prodding, the kind the tube has gotten so good at.

Elsewhere, the North Carolina family man lets his inner (and outer, actually) goatee- and eyeliner-type guy rip: his built-for-the-hard-stuff voice bites down appealingly on ""Breakdown,"" a dark serenade to mental health, and also on ""What I Want,"" an \'80s-style fist-pumper featuring Slash. The loud mad dash of those songs leads to a midtempo wind-down (""All These Lives,"" ""What About Now""), but as a mix, it works. Daughtry is a man of many moods--contemplative, explosive, insistent, humble. No matter which pokes through on a given song, he steadies it to a place as honest as it is accessible.

Lyrically, the album is not overtly political but offers an insightful, plain-spoken perspective on contemporary conditions. The lyrics, contemplative and hopeful, are set off by the garage-born organic sound of Mellencamp and his band. Band members participating in the sessions for Freedom's Road included Mike Wanchic (guitar, vocals), Andy York (guitar, vocals, flute-a-phone), Miriam Sturm (violin), John Gunnell (bass), Dane Clark (drums), and Troye Kinnett (keyboards). The album's tone and themes are underscored by such Mellencamp-penned originals as 'Ghost Towns Along The Highway,' 'Rural Route,' and 'The Americans.' Of the album's title track, Mellencamp notes, `Freedom's Road' is a promise that you have to go through hell to redeem. Billboard called Our Country an appreciable fable of tolerance, hope and empowerment, citing his latest offering as 'a jubilant return.'"", 'The heartland rocker\'s first album of all-new material in more than five years finds John Mellencamp in full anthem mode. This is his State of the Union address, with guitars that chime like the Byrds heralding sentiments that recall the socially-conscious 1960s, yet sound all the more pertinent today. Balancing the desolate landscape of ""Ghost Towns Along the Highway,"" the hell-on-earth of ""Rural Route,"" and the tolls demanded on the title track\'s ""Freedom\'s Road"" are the embrace of brotherhood on ""Someday,"" the Everyman populism of ""The Americans,"" and the soaring transcendence of ""My Aeroplane."" Within the context of the album\'s song cycle, the ""Our Country"" centerpiece sounds richer and more powerful than it has as a truck commercial--like a roots-rocking sequel to Woody Guthrie\'s ""This Land Is Your Land."" Mellencamp enlists Joan Baez for a duet on the protest ballad ""Jim Crow,"" while saving his most blistering political commentary for the unlisted bonus track, ""Rodeo Clown."" <i>--Don McLeese</i>']"

That sound led to a daydream about the end of the world. That daydream stuck with me and over time revealed itself to be much more. I believe sometimes you have a choice in what inspiration you choose to follow and other times you really don\'t. This record is the latter. Once I tuned into it, everything fell into place... as if it were meant to be. With a framework established, the songs were very easy to write. Things started happening in my ""real"" life that blurred the lines of what was fiction and what wasn\'t. The record turned out to be more than a just a record in scale, as you will see over time. Part one is year zero. Concept record. Sixteen tracks. All written and performed by me, produced / programmed by me and Atticus Ross, mixed by Alan Moulder, mastered by Brian ""Big Bass"" Gardner. Release date: April 17, 2007. What\'s it about? Well, it takes place about fifteen years in the future. Things are not good. If you imagine a world where greed and power continue to run their likely course, you\'ll have an idea of the backdrop. The world has reached the breaking point - politically, spiritually and ecologically. Written from various perspectives of people in this world, ""year zero"" examines various viewpoints set against an impending moment of truth. How does it sound? You will hear for yourself soon enough, but given the point of this document is to provide information... This record is much more of a ""sound collage"" than recent efforts from me. A lot of it was improvised. It is very tedious describing your own music. It\'s not just music. It\'s probably too long, but it felt like the right thing to do to paint the complete picture. It will sound different after a few listens. You can think about it and it will reveal more than you were expecting. You can dance to a lot of it. You can f*** to a lot of it (maybe all of it depending on what you\'re into).', 'Nine Inch Nails\' sixth studio release, <i>Year Zero</i> takes the concept album further than it may have ever gone before. In advance of its release, URLs were hidden in tour t-shirts, music- and image-filled USB drives were \'found\' at concerts, and dozens of websites have been packed with conspiracy stories that all involve the year 2022 or \'Year Zero.\' Each clue is part of a cohesive whole, requiring a listener to follow an exhaustive web trail to grasp the entire tale. Focusing specifically on the music, ""The Beginning of the End,"" the powerful first vocal track, is like the sonic and lyrical equivalent of an emotional ascension to a rollercoaster\'s peak, with the last few cacophonic seconds equaling the fall of individual freedoms. ""Survivalism,"" <i>Year Zero</i>\'s first single, follows with guest vocalist/Slam artist Saul Williams pumping up the passion in its urgent chorus. While still industrial in genre, it\'s clear that Trent Reznor\'s musical evolution finds him bringing more mellow songs to the mix than he has on previous discs (""The Good Soldier,"" ""The Greater Good,"" ""In This Twilight"") as well as an increased number of funk-affected rhythms, specifically in standout tracks ""Capitol G"" and ""Me, I\'m Not."" Devotees of NIN\'s harder sound will appreciate the metallic crunch of ""My Violent Heart"" and ""Meet Your Master."" On the whole, the Nine Inch Nails we hear on <i>Year Zero</i> is less focused on producing heavy music and more focused on delivering its heavy, conspiratorial doomsday message. <i>--Denise Sheppard</i>']"

It's here that Tull finally bursts into full-blown prog-rock mode. While AQUALUNG was a group of discrete compositions united by a theme, THICK AS A BRICK consists of one extended piece that occupies the leng th of the album. Lyrically, Anderson's intentions are a bit more obscure here, but the sophisticated arrangements and virtuosic performances are enough to carry the show. John Evan's piano and organ are at the heart of this complex piece, which moves through an endless succession of tempos, moods and modes in a manner similar to vintage Genesis or the aforementioned Yes, but with a grittier edge. Most importantly, the whole things flows in a cohesive manner. THICK AS A BRICK demands close attention, but rewards the same handsomely. Originally released in 1972.

Superstar and legendary musician prince kicked off 2007 with a show stopping Super Bowls Half-time performance. Prince pulled out all the stops during the second most-watched super bowl broadcast ever. With an estimated 93.2 million viewers to entertain, Prince wasted no time showing off his stages powers and irrefutable guitar skills. He masterfully captured the attention and respect of music fans in general, while sending a message to long time Prince fans that he was ready to once again reign supreme.', 'Because it would be un-Prince-like to release a new studio album without kicking up a little controversy first, the Artist Formerly Known As a Cool-Looking Symbol gave away copies of <I>Planet Earth</I> with a British news tabloid weeks before its U.S. release. Among the reasons he shouldn\'t have: nobody who catches wind of the peerless funk-rock-soul he lays out on these 10 tracks--least of all longtime fans--would think twice about shelling out for it. A big chunk of the appeal is that Prince finds his way back to his guitar here. The title track, a politically right-on-time environmental rant, steers him back toward ""Purple Rain"" territory, as does ""Lion of Judah"" (""Guitar,"" oddly, doesn\'t--it\'s more of a straight-up, shout-it-out modern rocker). And the flirty numbers are seriously flammable: ""Somewhere Here on Earth"" seduces with a crackly jazz vibe, while ""Mr. Goodnight"" gets friendly with a refined slip of rap. Coolest of all are two tracks at cross purposes-- ""Chelsea Rodgers"" fuses funk with disco until it\'s so far off the hook it\'s in a heap on the floor, and ""All the Midnights in the World"" paints a picture of artistic maturity through piano and lyrics that lean hard on positivity. There\'s an elegance to it that Prince fans, no strangers to pop music that\'s truly sublime, won\'t fail to appreciate. <I>--Tammy La Gorce</I>']"

At times, Burnette\'s spare and deliberate soundscape--incisively crafted by guitarists Marc Ribot and Norman Blake, bassist Dennis Crouch, drummer Jay Bellerose, and multi-instrumentalist Mike Seeger, among others--is nearly as dreamy and subterranean as Daniel Lanois\'s work with Emmylou Harris (<i>Wrecking Ball</i>).

Restrained instrumentation--often simply guitar, upright bass, a sprinkling of piano, and light percussion--turn even the teenage bubble-gum anthem ""I Only Want to Be with You"" into a sultry meditation. It\'s hard to imagine another recent album more successful in melding retro-reverence with contemporary moderation. The result arouses emotion even as it enchantingly relaxes. <i>--Ben Heege</i>']"

Indeed he may go down as one of the best artists in hip-hop period. One look at Lil Wayne\'s impeccable track record will convince even the most ardent skeptic that the New Orleans born lyricist is a strong contender for the crown of ""Greatest of All Times."" <P>In the span of his 13-year career, Lil Wayne has sold over six million units, including his magnum opus, The Carter II (2005) which sold over 2.5 million units. He has been featured on numerous high profile singles including Fat Joe\'s Grammy nominated single ""Make It Rain,"" and in the past two years, Lil Wayne has recorded over 1,000 songs and freestyles. According to MTV, Lil Wayne has released more music in the last two years than the legendary Tupac Shakur. <P>Now with his highly anticipated sixth and arguably his best album The Carter III, Lil Wayne\'s career and legacy is set to climb to even greater heights. &#34;I made The Carter III so that whatever song is on, it will stick with you forever,"" says Wayne. ""That\'s why I took my time with it. I wanted it to be a classic."" <P>A classic it will truly be. With production by Alchemist, Cool & Dre, David Banner, Kanye West, and Jim Jonsin, to name a few, and guest appearances by some of today\'s premiere recording artists including T-Pain (Got Money), Bobby Valentino (Mr. Officer), Babyface (Comfortable), Juelz Santana & Fabolous (Ain\'t Got Nuthin) and a special guest appearance by the legendary R&B singer Ms. Betty Wright (Play With Fire), Tha Carter III is an eclectic collection of 15 songs that range from simply brilliant to sheer genius. <P>The first single from the Tha Carter III, ""Lollipop,"" featuring Static Major is the bubbling lead single that has Wayne delivering his clever lyrics laced with racy double entendres over a funky slow burning beat. Lil Wayne\'s second single, ""A Milli""which was produced by Bangladesh (Ciara & Ludacris), is a booming 808 laced track augmented by a tight rhythmic snare, accented by handclaps and a sample that matches Wayne\'s staccato flow perfectly. In ""Mr. Carter"" featuring Jay-Z, we find the two trading introspective lyrics about their lives and legacy in the rap game with Wayne at his lyrical best dropping stream of conscious gems like: ""I got the flo\', I\'m tryin\' to see the roof/Didn\'t wear a bulletproof so I got shot, you can see the proof/Blind eyes can look at me and see the truth/Wonder if Stevie do?"" <P>Born DeWayne Michael Carter, Jr. and raised in New Orleans infamously poor Hollygrove neighborhood, Lil Wayne was discovered by Cash Money CEO Brian ""Birdman"" Williams <P>when a mutual friend introduced him to the pre-teen rapper. The Birdman immediately saw a spark in the youngster\'s eyes and took him under his wing. In 1993, Lil Wayne and fellow Cash Money rapper B.G. came together as a duo called The BGs and released their debut EP True Stories. In 1997, a 15 year old Wayne joined forces with BG, Juvenile and Turk to form The Hot Boys for their debut album Get It How U Live. The record sold over 400,000 copies independently. The Hot Boys sophomore LP Guerilla Warfare (1999) went platinum and earned Wayne critical acclaim. That set the stage for his platinum selling 1999 solo debut Tha Block Is Hot. The album yielded a number one single with the title tune and was certified double platinum. <P>The following year Wayne released his sophomore LP Lights Out, which reached gold status and in 2002, Lil Wayne dropped his third solo LP 500 Degrees. It too went gold. Two years later Wayne released The Carter, the first album in the trilogy that would elevate Wayne to superstar status. The Carter (2004) was a commercial success selling over one million copies and reaching #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 Charts and #2 on the Hot R&B/Hip Hop chart. In 2005, Wayne released The Carter II, which sold over 1.8 million records. 2006 saw the release of Like Father, Like Son, a collaboration between Lil Wayne and Birdman which has sold over 750,000 units. <P>GQ Magazine named Lil Wayne as its ""Man Of The Year"" for 2007. Rolling Stone Magazine tagged him as ""Best MC of 2008"" while Blender Magazine (2008) named him the ""Best Rock Star Alive."" So it should come as no surprise that his latest solo outing finds the hip-hop super star at the top of his game. With Tha Carter III, Lil Wayne proves to the world why he is indeed considered ""the best rapper alive"" and one of the great recording artists of his generation.']"

Importantly, though, they\'ve shaken it. While the core trio of Beth Gibbons, Geoff Barrow, and Adrian Utley remains, this is quite a different band to Portishead\'s 90s incarnation: gone is the slo-mo turntable scratching and smoky jazz feel, replaced by heavy, brooding rhythms, vintage-sounding electronics, and spindly guitar. Still present, though, is that sense of emotional fracture and deep gloom. ""Silence"" opens with a dense drum loop which suddenly falls away to reveal Gibbons\' voice, cold but magnificent: ""Wounded and afraid, inside my head/Falling through changes"". ""Nylon Smile"", meanwhile, is a fine example of <i>Third</i>\'s occasional folksy edge, an acoustic song reminiscent of Leonard Cohen that, around its midpoint, lifts off on a propulsive electronic rhythm, Gibbons holding one clear, hard note as synthesisers bubble beneath. At times, it\'s a harsh and foreboding listen: the electronic drums of ""Machine Gun"" might put off the listener hoping for smooth dinner party fare. But <i>Third</i> is a brave and forward-thinking return, and one great enough to justify its lengthy gestation. <i>--Louis Pattison</i>']"

Zukowski <P>Taylor Swift\'s new CD &#34;Fearless&#34; comes out today. Other new releases include Enya, T-Pain, Tracy Chapman and David Archuleta. Taylor Swift is just 18 years old. But for me she\'s done something really important for mainstream country music: she\'s put some feeling and soul back into country. <P>Swift writes her own songs (unusual for a country singer). And a lot of her songs are about her hopes and her experiences. So it doesn\'t matter that she\'s just 18. It sounds real. And that honesty is what makes the best country music. And she makes other country singers older than her seem phony in comparison -- even someone not so old like Carrie Underwood. <P>Swift\'s second album &#34;Fearless&#34; comes out today. She played the title song from it on &#34;The Late Show&#34; with David Letterman last night and it sounded great. The lyrics were really heartfelt and direct.

Ollison Seemingly out of nowhere in 2006, Taylor Swift did what is becoming almost impossible to do in today\'s crumbling music industry: She sold more than 3 million copies of her first album. And the country-pop star did it all rather quietly, garnering a Grammy nomination for best new artist along the way. <P>Svelte and blond with a sculptured face the camera adores, the 16- year-old singer wasn\'t a teen dream manufactured by the Disney machine. She also wasn\'t packaged as a vampish pop tart, wailing suggestive songs that belied her years. <P>Her earnest but girlish vocals were ensconced in sympathetic arrangements that were more pop than country. But it was Swift\'s gift as a songwriter that pushed her ahead of the pack. She wrote about her bad luck with boys in detailed, sometimes touching lyrics that never felt too precious. In fact, Swift\'s songs are sturdy and universal enough to work in any musical context. <P>On Fearless, her hotly anticipated sophomore album, she basically sticks with what worked on the debut. She\'s 18 now. And although her maturation on the album is deliberately pitched to the country-pop crossover crowd, Swift\'s songs remain tightly crafted. The melodies may not always be immediate, but the tunes still worm their way into your head. <P>Lyrically, Swift is still boy-crazy. She achingly pines for the dreamy ones (&#34;Love Story,&#34; &#34;You Belong With Me,&#34; and the breezy title track) and dismisses the empty-headed ones (&#34;Tell Me Why&#34; and &#34;White Horse&#34;). She refreshingly eschews the role of diva wannabe and remains the down-to-earth girlfriend next door. <P>&#34;The Best Day,&#34; an affecting ballad, is a lovely valentine to her family. Simple and understated, it\'s sure to be a hit with fans. -- <i>Baltimore Sun, November 11, 2008</i><br /><br />Swift Fearless, taking the spotlight away from Rose BY WERNER TRIESCHMANN <P>This is so old-school pop star. <P>Three days before Christmas and a stop at west Little Rock\'s Best Buy to snag Taylor Swift\'s Fearless turns up empty - that\'s right, not a single copy to be had in the whole store. Boxes of Guitar Hero and gleaming iNanos were still waiting to be bought. Then there were the well-stocked displays for a certain new album by Guns \'N Roses. <P>Taylor Alison Swift, who turned 19 on Dec. 19, was only 4 years old when Axl Rose started working on Chinese Democracy. Today, however, Swift, the cat-eyed, curly-haired singersongwriter, is the most popular music act in the country. Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers have the power of the \'tween marketplace and the mighty Disney behind them, but only two full-length albums into her career, Swift is challenging the rule that nobody makes rock stars anymore. <P>Swift is, of course, slotted as a country act and her first big hit, &#34;Tim McGraw,&#34; reinforced that label. Among the many things that Fearless confirms, the foremost might be that the Pennsylvania-native Swift is navigating the broad waters of pop music. There\'s a banjo and fiddle here and there on Fearless, but the symphonic strings and general guitar uplift dominate. <P>You already know what Fearless is about - or maybe your favorite/closest teenager informed you in a breathless text message filled with exclamation points and all caps. Romance! Doomed romance! Being 15 and being crazy in love with Romeo even though of course it can\'t work out because he\'s a vampire - oh wait, that\'s something else. <P>Maybe you also already know that Swift\'s name is on all of these songs and that there are only five or so where the teenager shares credit with John Rich (of Big & Rich fame) and others. Maybe you\'ve already decided that you love or hate this young, beautiful and now-rich singer-songwriter because of what you already know. <P>It\'s not likely that even Swift\'s biggest fans could tell from her low-key, mostly-acoustic, happy-to-be-here debut that the girl has a gift that translates to a bigger stage. That is to say, Fearless is about as tightly constructed and as hook-heavy as any pop record could be. The hits are certainly going to keep on coming after &#34;Love Story&#34; has its run on the charts. <P>While most of the early praise for the record has focused on Swift\'s sharp eye for detail (the nervous anticipation that comes with the first day of high school and the insanity that comes with young love), few have spoken about her voice. Although you can take it to the bank that Nashville\'s most expensive machines were applied to smooth out the edges, Swift is still able to convey the passion - the fragile feelings - that drives so many of these songs. <P>Taken as a whole, the great sweep of the production elevates Fearless, makes it more than a heartsick diary typed on perfumed resume paper. That\'s not to say that Swift\'s obsession over the fickle ways of young men doesn\'t start to wear. <P>The last song - the abstract, gospel-ish &#34;Change&#34; - isn\'t enough of a curve to break up the feel that too many of the tunes here are about the same thing with the same kind of tempo. <P>But even at 19 years old, Swift is smart enough to play to her strengths and her strengths are enough to make Fearless rich and satisfying in ways that few albums can match. Eat your heart out, Axl Rose. -- <i>Arkansas Democrat Gazette, December 28, 2008</i><br /><br />Taylor Swift hits all the right words on \'Fearless\' * * * (out of four) <P>SWIFT UNSPIFFED <P>For the past decade, the term singer/songwriter has been liberally applied to hot young artists who rely on more experienced collaborators to hone their tunes, and to provide the savvy production that usually upstages the melody and lyrics anyway. But Swift cut her creative teeth in Nashville, where storytelling still matters; and for her sophomore album, Fearless, she wrote more than half the songs independently, and clearly had a big hand in the rest. <P>You just can\'t fake the kind of innocence and wonder that ring through the glowing title track and the moonstruck single Love Story, or the guileless urgency and unmannered precociousness marking more bittersweet songs such as Fifteen and White Horse. <P>Swift\'s grainy-sweet vocals have a similar freshness, even on the less memorable cuts. It\'s a pleasure to hear a gifted teenager who sounds like a gifted teenager, rather than a mouthpiece for a bunch of older pros\' collective notion of adolescent yearning. -- Elysa Gardner -- <i>USA Today, November 11, 2008</i><br /><br />Taylor Swift, \'Fearless\' <P>Nashville\'s hottest young star lives up the hype <P>By Andy Hermann Critic\'s Rating: 4 1/2 stars out of 5 <P>The buzz: All Taylor Swift did with her self-titled debut album was sell three million copies, produce a pair of chart-topping singles (""Our Song"" and ""Should\'ve Said No""), get nominated for a Best New Artist Grammy and win virtually every country music award a newcomer can get. Two years later, Nashville\'s teen phenom is now all of 18 and ready to show that her debut was no fluke. <P>The verdict: Swift is already a superstar in country music circles, but ""Fearless"" should catapult her to the top of the pop heap, as well. It\'s very nearly a flawless record, full of big-hearted anthems with catchy melodies, chiming, pop-radio guitars (and the occasional fiddle and banjo, as if to say, ""Don\'t worry, I\'m still a Nashville girl at heart"") and disarmingly frank lyrics about being an average American kid with real-life hopes, dreams and dramas. On ""Fifteen,"" she captures the wide-eyed excitement of dating older boys in high school, singing ""he\'s got a car!"" like it\'s the most exciting thing imaginable. ""Hey Stephen"" is an irresistibly sunny come-on of a love song; ""The Best Day"" miraculously manages to portray a happy childhood without getting cloying or sentimental; even lead single ""Love Story,"" with its corny ""Romeo and Juliet"" references, is infused with so much sweetness and precocious wit that it\'s impossible not to get swept up in the song\'s surging chorus. Right from the get-go, it appeared that Swift\'s talent ran deep; on this record, she proves it, and then some. <P>Did you know? On the CMT show ""Crossroads,"" Swift teamed up British pop-metal veterans Def Leppard to perform songs like ""Photograph"" and ""Pour Some Sugar on Me."" (The pairing is less odd than it sounds; the producer behind those classic `80s Def Leppard albums, John ""Mutt"" Lange, also produced hits for one of Swift\'s biggest influences, Shania Twain.) -- <i>Metromix, November 10, 2008</i><br /><br />Those who thought Taylor Swift was a big deal after the release of her first record should be prepared: She\'s about to get way bigger. Though they\'re written by a teenager, Swift\'s songs have broad appeal, and therein lies the genius and accessibility of her second effort.

But for me she\'s done something really important for mainstream country music: she\'s put some feeling and soul back into country. <P>Swift writes her own songs (unusual for a country singer). And a lot of her songs are about her hopes and her experiences. So it doesn\'t matter that she\'s just 18. It sounds real. And that honesty is what makes the best country music. And she makes other country singers older than her seem phony in comparison -- even someone not so old like Carrie Underwood. <P>Swift\'s second album &#34;Fearless&#34; comes out today. She played the title song from it on &#34;The Late Show&#34; with David Letterman last night and it sounded great. The lyrics were really heartfelt and direct.

Ollison Seemingly out of nowhere in 2006, Taylor Swift did what is becoming almost impossible to do in today\'s crumbling music industry: She sold more than 3 million copies of her first album. And the country-pop star did it all rather quietly, garnering a Grammy nomination for best new artist along the way. <P>Svelte and blond with a sculptured face the camera adores, the 16- year-old singer wasn\'t a teen dream manufactured by the Disney machine. She also wasn\'t packaged as a vampish pop tart, wailing suggestive songs that belied her years. <P>Her earnest but girlish vocals were ensconced in sympathetic arrangements that were more pop than country. But it was Swift\'s gift as a songwriter that pushed her ahead of the pack. She wrote about her bad luck with boys in detailed, sometimes touching lyrics that never felt too precious. In fact, Swift\'s songs are sturdy and universal enough to work in any musical context. <P>On Fearless, her hotly anticipated sophomore album, she basically sticks with what worked on the debut. She\'s 18 now. And although her maturation on the album is deliberately pitched to the country-pop crossover crowd, Swift\'s songs remain tightly crafted. The melodies may not always be immediate, but the tunes still worm their way into your head. <P>Lyrically, Swift is still boy-crazy. She achingly pines for the dreamy ones (&#34;Love Story,&#34; &#34;You Belong With Me,&#34; and the breezy title track) and dismisses the empty-headed ones (&#34;Tell Me Why&#34; and &#34;White Horse&#34;). She refreshingly eschews the role of diva wannabe and remains the down-to-earth girlfriend next door. <P>&#34;The Best Day,&#34; an affecting ballad, is a lovely valentine to her family. Simple and understated, it\'s sure to be a hit with fans. -- <i>Baltimore Sun, November 11, 2008</i><br /><br />Swift Fearless, taking the spotlight away from Rose BY WERNER TRIESCHMANN <P>This is so old-school pop star. <P>Three days before Christmas and a stop at west Little Rock\'s Best Buy to snag Taylor Swift\'s Fearless turns up empty - that\'s right, not a single copy to be had in the whole store. Boxes of Guitar Hero and gleaming iNanos were still waiting to be bought. Then there were the well-stocked displays for a certain new album by Guns \'N Roses. <P>Taylor Alison Swift, who turned 19 on Dec. 19, was only 4 years old when Axl Rose started working on Chinese Democracy. Today, however, Swift, the cat-eyed, curly-haired singersongwriter, is the most popular music act in the country. Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers have the power of the \'tween marketplace and the mighty Disney behind them, but only two full-length albums into her career, Swift is challenging the rule that nobody makes rock stars anymore. <P>Swift is, of course, slotted as a country act and her first big hit, &#34;Tim McGraw,&#34; reinforced that label. Among the many things that Fearless confirms, the foremost might be that the Pennsylvania-native Swift is navigating the broad waters of pop music. There\'s a banjo and fiddle here and there on Fearless, but the symphonic strings and general guitar uplift dominate. <P>You already know what Fearless is about - or maybe your favorite/closest teenager informed you in a breathless text message filled with exclamation points and all caps. Romance! Doomed romance! Being 15 and being crazy in love with Romeo even though of course it can\'t work out because he\'s a vampire - oh wait, that\'s something else. <P>Maybe you also already know that Swift\'s name is on all of these songs and that there are only five or so where the teenager shares credit with John Rich (of Big & Rich fame) and others. Maybe you\'ve already decided that you love or hate this young, beautiful and now-rich singer-songwriter because of what you already know. <P>It\'s not likely that even Swift\'s biggest fans could tell from her low-key, mostly-acoustic, happy-to-be-here debut that the girl has a gift that translates to a bigger stage. That is to say, Fearless is about as tightly constructed and as hook-heavy as any pop record could be. The hits are certainly going to keep on coming after &#34;Love Story&#34; has its run on the charts. <P>While most of the early praise for the record has focused on Swift\'s sharp eye for detail (the nervous anticipation that comes with the first day of high school and the insanity that comes with young love), few have spoken about her voice. Although you can take it to the bank that Nashville\'s most expensive machines were applied to smooth out the edges, Swift is still able to convey the passion - the fragile feelings - that drives so many of these songs. <P>Taken as a whole, the great sweep of the production elevates Fearless, makes it more than a heartsick diary typed on perfumed resume paper. That\'s not to say that Swift\'s obsession over the fickle ways of young men doesn\'t start to wear. <P>The last song - the abstract, gospel-ish &#34;Change&#34; - isn\'t enough of a curve to break up the feel that too many of the tunes here are about the same thing with the same kind of tempo. <P>But even at 19 years old, Swift is smart enough to play to her strengths and her strengths are enough to make Fearless rich and satisfying in ways that few albums can match. Eat your heart out, Axl Rose. -- <i>Arkansas Democrat Gazette, December 28, 2008</i><br /><br />Taylor Swift hits all the right words on \'Fearless\' * * * (out of four) <P>SWIFT UNSPIFFED <P>For the past decade, the term singer/songwriter has been liberally applied to hot young artists who rely on more experienced collaborators to hone their tunes, and to provide the savvy production that usually upstages the melody and lyrics anyway. But Swift cut her creative teeth in Nashville, where storytelling still matters; and for her sophomore album, Fearless, she wrote more than half the songs independently, and clearly had a big hand in the rest. <P>You just can\'t fake the kind of innocence and wonder that ring through the glowing title track and the moonstruck single Love Story, or the guileless urgency and unmannered precociousness marking more bittersweet songs such as Fifteen and White Horse. <P>Swift\'s grainy-sweet vocals have a similar freshness, even on the less memorable cuts. It\'s a pleasure to hear a gifted teenager who sounds like a gifted teenager, rather than a mouthpiece for a bunch of older pros\' collective notion of adolescent yearning. -- Elysa Gardner -- <i>USA Today, November 11, 2008</i><br /><br />Taylor Swift, \'Fearless\' <P>Nashville\'s hottest young star lives up the hype <P>By Andy Hermann Critic\'s Rating: 4 1/2 stars out of 5 <P>The buzz: All Taylor Swift did with her self-titled debut album was sell three million copies, produce a pair of chart-topping singles (""Our Song"" and ""Should\'ve Said No""), get nominated for a Best New Artist Grammy and win virtually every country music award a newcomer can get. Two years later, Nashville\'s teen phenom is now all of 18 and ready to show that her debut was no fluke. <P>The verdict: Swift is already a superstar in country music circles, but ""Fearless"" should catapult her to the top of the pop heap, as well. It\'s very nearly a flawless record, full of big-hearted anthems with catchy melodies, chiming, pop-radio guitars (and the occasional fiddle and banjo, as if to say, ""Don\'t worry, I\'m still a Nashville girl at heart"") and disarmingly frank lyrics about being an average American kid with real-life hopes, dreams and dramas. On ""Fifteen,"" she captures the wide-eyed excitement of dating older boys in high school, singing ""he\'s got a car!"" like it\'s the most exciting thing imaginable. ""Hey Stephen"" is an irresistibly sunny come-on of a love song; ""The Best Day"" miraculously manages to portray a happy childhood without getting cloying or sentimental; even lead single ""Love Story,"" with its corny ""Romeo and Juliet"" references, is infused with so much sweetness and precocious wit that it\'s impossible not to get swept up in the song\'s surging chorus. Right from the get-go, it appeared that Swift\'s talent ran deep; on this record, she proves it, and then some. <P>Did you know? On the CMT show ""Crossroads,"" Swift teamed up British pop-metal veterans Def Leppard to perform songs like ""Photograph"" and ""Pour Some Sugar on Me."" (The pairing is less odd than it sounds; the producer behind those classic `80s Def Leppard albums, John ""Mutt"" Lange, also produced hits for one of Swift\'s biggest influences, Shania Twain.) -- <i>Metromix, November 10, 2008</i><br /><br />Those who thought Taylor Swift was a big deal after the release of her first record should be prepared: She\'s about to get way bigger.

""That word `epiphany\' just meant so much to me, because it was during the time that I was preparing to record that something clicked in my spirit."" Chrisette\'s coming back much tougher! Nowhere does that toughness come across more than on the soulful ""Blame It on Me."" An awesome ballad that colors itself with a little Muscle Shoals soul, there is red dirt earthiness that is just completely raw. ""You can say whatever you want, as long as its goodbye,"" Chrisette wails coldly. <P>That song is an amazing collaboration with Claude Kelly and Chrisette\'s writing with Chuck Harmony producing. A producer/ songwriter who is part of Ne-Yo\'s production collective Compound Entertainment, Chuck has worked on projects with Mary J. Blige, Janet Jackson and Celine Dion.<P>Since the release of her I Am, Chrisette has always toured endlessly with her band: the Truth and other R&B singers, Raheem DeVaughn, and Solange Knowles. ""To me, nothing is more important than touring,"" she says. ""Communicating with the audience through song can be magical. Singing in the studio is one thing, but you must be able to bring it to the stage too."" <P>Citing Japan and Barbados as two of her favorite spots, Chrisette explains, ""In Japan, it is just about the music, and an artist is judged by the material, not the latest gossip. While, in Barbados audiences just show such a passion, like they can pick-up what is going on in your heart."" In addition, Chrisette also found time to record with The Roots (""Rising Up"") and The Game (""Let Us Live""). <P>""Honestly, I was anxious when I went to work with Game, but he turned out to be one of the nicest people I\'ve ever met, and now he calls me `cuz\'"" Chrisette admits.<P>As if that was not enough, Chrisette also started working on her acting chops after appearing on an episode of Girlfriends. Playing herself in &#34;What\'s Black-A-Lacking,&#34; an episode directed by series star Tracee Ellis Ross, she says, ""That experience was amazing, because they allowed me to have so much input and let me to write my own scenes. Truthfully, there is no feeling like seeing myself on TV."" Ne-Yo and Harmony were inspired to write ""Another One."" Opening with a lovely acoustic guitar and Chrisette singing quietly, ""Another One"" slowly builds to the point of explosion. ""That is my favorite song on the album,"" Chrisette admits. Mixing rock guitars with hip-hop drum patterns, the track is an obvious winner. ""Nobody captures New American music like Ne-Yo and the Compound crew.""<P>Chrisette Michele worked with Rodney jerkins on the first album. ""Anybody who thinks they can go into the studio with Rodney and not work is kidding themselves,"" she laughs. <P>While angst and heartbreak is part of Chrisette Michele\'s persona on her sophomore project, the power and strength of her material gives Epiphany the sound of a future classic. Without a doubt, this is the first great album of 2009.']"

B0026P3G12,A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S,0,1259712000,I Dreamed A Dream,Susan Boyle,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Pop', 'Singer-Songwriters']","[""2009 debut from the vocalist who became an overnight sensation after appearing on the first round of 2009's popular UK reality show Britain's Got Talent. Boyle caught the judges (and the world) off guard with her masterful rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' from the musical Les Misrables. Within hours of her appearance on the show, Boyle was not only an internet sensation; she was a world-wide phenomenon. This is the musical story of the year!"", '', 'January 21st 2009 is not a date that Susan Boyle is ever likely to forget. &lsquo;I will never forget it,&rsquo; she clarifies, in her unmistakeably Celtic brogue. It was the day that the shy, devout 48 year old stepped onto the stage of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow for an audition on Britain&rsquo;s Got Talent. Or to put it another way, the day her world turned 360 degrees on its head. In front of the three-strong panel of judges charged with divining which of this year&rsquo;s British hopefuls really did have talent, the singing voice of Susan Boyle turned out to be a watershed moment neither she nor anyone involved in the show could possibly have foreseen. It is now both her and the show&rsquo;s defining moment.', 'In her own haphazard fashion, during three and a half minutes of television airtime, later aired to slack-jawed intakes of breath in May of this year, Susan Boyle fashioned a new kind of fame. She elicited a moment of pure, molten zeitgeist. She broke every rule of the talent show book and tore up a considerable number of the pages of popular music marketing into the bargain. She symbolized an astonishing variety of the little-people&rsquo;s revenge, quite by accident. Ms Boyle describes her own astonishing 2009 in refreshingly frank and simple terms. &lsquo;All I did was to apply for a talent show. I was lucky enough to be chosen. That&rsquo;s it in a nutshell.&rsquo; But something deeper was going on in the collective public consciousness. If the two watchwords of the 21st century have been &lsquo;reality&rsquo; and &lsquo;celebrity&rsquo;, Susan Boyle had accidentally located a brand new point on the graph where they both intersected. One of Britain&rsquo;s forgotten characters had rarely, if ever, been so memorable.', 'After her one audition for Britain&rsquo;s Got Talent, in which she confounded the judges, the audience and then anyone with access to Youtube&rsquo;s expectations by dazzling her way through a version of the song I Dreamed A Dream, from the musical Les Miserables, a tornado of opinionated column inches, speculation, rumination and conjecture around Susan Boyle grew feverishly. 300 Million You Tube hits and counting. She became the subject of op-ed newspaper columns, a front cover sensation in her own right. This unlikely candidate for the melting pot of the new star machine in 21st century Britain caused computer crashes, miles of newsprint and the sophisticated approval of Hollywood&rsquo;s well-heeled and super-groomed A-list. Though the content differed wildly, everyone proffering their thoughts on the self-confessed &lsquo;wee wifey&rsquo; seemed agreed on one point. That in 2009, to be free of an opinion on Susan Boyle was to be free of opinion itself.', 'For one brief moment, vanity itself collapsed. As that ancient old maxim &ndash; &lsquo;Never judge a book by its cover&rsquo; &ndash; clanked around the globe with speedy viral intensity, it was as if the world was about to offer its first unspoken apology for prizing beauty above all else. Perhaps it would temporarily forget its grotesquely accentuated new heights of judgement. Or perhaps Susan Boyle was just a fleeting icon by which a microscope was shone on our more fickle presumptions. Whatever history gifts the Susan Boyle story in the long term, it is now her time to prove that there is more to this incredible woman than being the symbol for a moment of international reflection. She will do it in the exact same way she entered our consciousness in the first place. With the raw combination of strength and fragility, beauty and solitude that is her singing voice.', 'In some ways, Ms Boyle&rsquo;s story is just the same as any woman with a voice in any choir up and down the UK. In her home town of Blackburn, she had been schooled in singing in churches and choral societies. She says now that, as a shy young woman with some learning difficulties, being hidden in the blanket of a collective singing arrangement offered her comfort. So in one other, crucial way, her story is entirely her own. The most unlikely chorister in the sea of voices stepped out of line and put her head above the parapet to be noticed. For Susan Boyle, though she would never deign to say so much herself, this was an act of personal heroism, the like of which she had never contemplated before.', 'The speed with which reaction to her performance picked up gravitas proved an incendiary media hotbed. But it was most surprising for the woman at the centre of it. &lsquo;It started off with the [Scottish newspaper] Daily Record visiting my door. And it ended up with TV stations from all over the world camping out on my street waiting for interviews and stories. I&rsquo;d peak behind the curtains in the house, saying &lsquo;what in God&rsquo;s name is going on here?&rsquo; Then the phone calls started. My number was still in the book at that particular time, so anybody could get it and the phone was ringing 24 hours a day. It was constant. People were ringing me who I couldn&rsquo;t understand because of their accents. All sorts of nationalities. Lots of Americans. It was absolutely unbelievable if I&rsquo;m being honest.&rsquo; She is self-deprecating about why she should have caused such a furore. &lsquo;A woman who went on with mad hair, bushy eyebrows and the frock I was wearing had to be noticed. Come on!&rsquo;', 'Such is the quick nature of today&rsquo;s star system, in September, just four months after her TV debut, Susan Boyle made her live TV comeback. She performed a rarefied take on The Rolling Stones Wild Horses, re-orchestrated to gently clasp the exact timbre of her natural talent, on the show&rsquo;s US cousin, America&rsquo;s Got Talent. An unprompted standing ovation followed. Outside of the unruly cyclone of her fame, there is something within the voice of Susan Boyle that is absolutely perfect for our times. At a moment when Dame Vera Lynn and Barbra Streisand are topping the album charts, there is something peculiarly modern about her improbably status as holding the international record for most pre-ordered album of all time. As the dust settles on the sheer wattage of conversation that she has prompted, it is time &ndash; as they say &ndash; to face the music.', 'Ms Boyle&rsquo;s debut album was put together during the summer of this year. She first entered a recording studio in July in Edinburgh, to test how her vocals would respond to tape. The results shocked both her and veteran producer Steve Mac. Decamping to London, she fashioned the record over two months, picking songs that resonated with her, that pricked something within that she felt ready to unleash through music. &lsquo;It was important that I could feel everything I was singing,&rsquo; she says, cutting straight to the core of why music can be such a useful release, an escape valve from the everyday.', 'A disarming mix of the sacred (&lsquo;My faith is my backbone,&rsquo; she says) and the secular, there is not a moment on it that is not moving. It is pitched exactly within the framework of the year she has enjoyed and, at well-documented times, endured. It is a collection of covers and original material that cuts a swathe into the interior life of the woman who is arguably the most intriguing, not to mention instantly recognisable character yet to be produced by the reality talent medium, the decade&rsquo;s defining TV genre.', 'When she hurts, it hurts. Her rousing rendition of Madonna&rsquo;s You&rsquo;ll See is a riposte to the children that picked on her in the playground. The new composition Who I Was Born To Be is an astonishing testament to self-belief against some startling odds. Yet when she dreams, we dream too. Because of her uncanny knack of picking a song so perfect for her tale at that very first audition, Ms Boyle has become synonymous with the word &lsquo;dream&rsquo;. Her flawless album rendition of I Dreamed A Dream may come as no surprise, but it still manages to pick every individual hair from the back of your neck and yank them to attention. A country ballad version of Daydream Believer delicately seals the deal of her being synonymous with the concept of dreaming.', 'For this is Susan Boyle&rsquo;s tale. The fearlessness to dream about something other than the lot life has handed you. The chance to escape. The pivotal role of music as a conduit to go to another place, sometimes lodged at the outer recesses of your imagination, and to allow that new place to blossom. Yes, this is Susan Boyle&rsquo;s tale. It is why it connected with so many unsuspecting people across the world. In another nutshell? If she can dare to dream, so can you.', 'SUSANS DEBUT ALBUM &ldquo;I DREAMED A DREAM&rdquo; IS RELEASED IN THE UK/WORLDWIDE ON NOVEMBER 23RD', '&ldquo;I Dreamed a Dream&rsquo; is already the most pre-ordered album worldwide of all time.']"

Mercury."", 'Imperfections are in the eye of the beholder. You can see them as flaws, or as the very qualities that make us human -- and that make us strive to be better people in search of a perfection that we know we can never fully achieve. In the thirteen songs on her spellbinding new album, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, Mariah Carey explores those aspects of our shared humanity with a rare depth, honesty and open-heartedness. It\'s one of the strongest statements in her long, distinguished career. <P>The subject of Memoirs is love at all its stages in our lives. Experiencing it for the first time. Losing it. Remembering its most painful moments, and also its times of greatest innocence and joy. Yearning for it. Learning from it. Growing as a result of its profound power. Finding it again and being grateful for so great a gift. And, finally, being humbled, filled with wonder and elevated by love\'s mysterious ways. In that sense and more, Memoirs is a full, immensely satisfying journey. <P>""Each song is like an intimate conversation or entry in a private diary,"" Carey says about the album. ""A lot of the songs reflect specific, different times in my life. Others were inspired by movies, actual events that happened to me, or the stories of friends who told me about experiences that they\'ve gone through."" With just one exception, Carey wrote and produced the entire album in collaboration with The-Dream and Tricky Stewart. The trio clearly shared an inspired sense of what Memoirs should be. Sinuous grooves and instantly memorable melodies flow from track to track, while the wit and intimacy of the lyrics create the feel of one friend talking to another. As well-defined as each song is, Memoirs plays with the beauty and consistency of a classic, start-to-finish album. <P>""My main goal was to work with people I could collaborate with without it seeming redundant or stale,"" Carey says. ""In my opinion Tricky is one of the most underrated major producers out there right now. I really enjoyed collaborating with him. And I especially liked writing with The-Dream, basically because we both love having fun with lyrics and melodies, and we\'re also capable of getting more serious on deeper songs. There is a particular sense of freedom I feel when we write together -- even though I make him stay in the studio all night until he is ready to kill me! LOL!"" <P>Memoirs\' first single is the hard-hitting ""Obsessed,"" which is accompanied by a video directed by Brett Ratner (the Rush Hour trilogy) in which Carey plays both the glamorous star and her stalker fan. Like the video, the song\'s lyrics combine devastating putdowns (""Last man on the Earth still couldn\'t get this"") with humor (""See right through you like you\'re bathin\' in Windex""). The no-nonsense ""Up Out My Face"" captures a similar caustic mood, dismissing a former lover with the send-off, ""When I break, I break, boy."" ""It\'s a Wrap"" delivers a similar message about the end of an affair: ""When it\'s gone, it\'s gone."" ""Standing O,"" with its irresistible chorus, sardonically applauds a faithless ex for his signature achievement: ""You played the one that loved you the most."" ""Betcha Gon\' Know"" foresees karmic revenge for a wayward lover, but, once again, the clever lyrics (""Oprah Winfrey whole segment for real, for real / 20/20 Barbara Walters for real, for real"") encourage a smile amid the pain. <P>The ballad ""H.A.T.E.U.,"" meanwhile, finds the singer seeing life in the wake of a breakup and longing for the moment when loss and regret transform into a cleansing anger. But the title of the song doesn\'t necessarily stand for what you think it might. ""H.A.T.E.U. is the first song I wrote for the album,"" Carey says, ""and it stands for Having A Typical Emotional Upset."" <P>Always a brilliant technical singer with an extraordinary vocal range, Carey rises to new heights on that track. ""I sing a recurring melody in the upper register of my voice; it\'s not an ad-lib, but an integral part of the song\'s hook,"" she says. ""That\'s not something I\'ve done before, and when listening back to it, it reminded me of how Minnie Riperton used her upper register on her hit song `Lovin\' You.\' I thought how ironic that her song was called `Lovin\' You\' and my song is called, `H.A.T.E.U.\' - and both use that upper `whistle register\' as a major part of the melody. So it\'s sort of an homage to Minnie Riperton, a tribute to her since she has been so influential in my singing style."" <P>On a tender note, the wistful ""Candy Bling"" beautifully evokes the blissful realm of young love (""Anklets, name plates that you gave to me/Sweet tarts, ring pops had that candy bling/And you were my world""), while ""Inseparable"" aches for a love that went wrong for reasons that seem impossible to comprehend. ""More Than Just Friends"" floats off into a fantasy of what a casual relationship might become (""Permanently paint me in your picture like Picasso/Love me down till I hit the top of my soprano!""). ""Ribbon"" and ""The Impossible"" swoon with happiness and thankfulness over redemptive love that has returned to make life rich again. ""You did the impossible,"" Carey sings. ""You rescued my love."" <P>Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel ends with a spectacularly powerful gospel rendition of Foreigner\'s gorgeous ballad, ""I Want to Know What Love Is."" Carey\'s voice soars into the heavens as a soul-stirring choir makes it clear that the search for love is the closest that any human being ever gets to the divine. <P>Which brings us back to the angel of the album\'s title. ""I had written a song called `Imperfect,\'"" Carey says, ""but it didn\'t make it onto the album. The lyrics of that song address the fact that the world puts so much pressure on us -- especially on women -- to be perfect and look a certain way, and that is impossible because nobody is perfect. Only God is perfect. I know I\'ve tried to be a good person, but I am definitely no angel!"" <P>""But after I put this album together and decided to name it Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel,"" she concludes, ""I remembered that the Minnie Riperton album that contained `Lovin\' You\' was called Perfect Angel. So I felt in so many ways that it was meant to be.""']"

Nicki the Boss- the ingenious austere business woman that always thinks outside of the box. Most importantly, this boss lady is never afraid to assert herself. Career <P>Nicki honed her innate ability and star potential at the renowned school of performing arts which was denoted in the movie and television series FAME. It was not long before she began to attract the attention of local producers and hip hop artist in the rap genre. Reluctant at first to cast herself, as a rapper her apprehension was predicated on the thought that the industry would attempt to limit her to one thing; when she knew that she was so much more. Decidedly, Nicki accepted the challenge and embarked on the journey of a female emcee in a hip hop world dominated by males. <P>It was not long before her lyrical skills were sought after by the likes of Lil\' Wayne. Nicki was determined not to befall the ill-fate of so many other talented female rappers. Instead she opted to qualify her lyrical skills through the ranks of the underground mix tape circuit. Success was inevitably achieved with her critically acclaimed performance credit on the DVD entitled ""The Come Up"" and mixtapes like Playtime is Over, the infamous Sucka Free, and Beam Me Up Scotty. Now in demand Nicki\'s role expands as a featured artist and female persona of Lil Wayne\'s record label Young Money Entertainment. In addition, she has a worked with celebrated recording artists Mariah Carey, Gucci Mane, Drake, Usher, Bobby Valentino, Ludacris, Robin Thicke, Jadakiss and Sean Garrett. <P>The evolution of Nicki Minaj continues as she exploits her talents as a singer and explores her passion as a writer.

How To Become Clairvoyant also features Steve Winwood and Trent Reznor as well as vocalists Angela McCluskey, Rocco Deluca, Dana Glover and Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes. Bassist Pino Palladino and drummer Ian Thomas lay down the groove throughout.<br><br>On his last two albums Robertson explored his ancestry. Now, with How To Become Clairvoyant, he takes on his rock heritage, delivering his first-ever song about leaving The Band, the evocative This Is Where I Get Off. What is lost? What is missing? Robertson asks on When The Night Was Young, a poignant reflection on youthful idealism. We could change the world/stop the war...but that was back when the night was young. <br> <br>The smoldering Straight Down The Line is a sly nod to rock n roll s early reputation as the Devil s music, while the blistering He Don t Live Here No More is a song about excess. The latter features Clapton on harmony vocal and electric and slide guitars alongside Robertson s soulful gut string guitar solo. <br><br>Robertson was a founding member of The Band, penning such classic songs as The Weight, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down and Up On Cripple Creek. The Band s 1976 farewell concert was documented by director Martin Scorsese in the film The Last Waltz and the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. In addition to his acclaimed solo albums, Robertson also has a long list of film credits. As Executive Soundtrack Producer for 1996 s Phenomenon, he recruited Clapton to perform Change the World, which subsequently won GRAMMY awards for Song of the Year and Record of the Year.

Across three decades, the pioneering powerhouse has shaped, refined and steadily broadened a determined style of blue collar power metal, soaring melodic hard rock and genre-defining thrash built from steadfast, muscular pulls at their own proverbial bootstraps. Overkill continues to power ahead through the changing musical landscape, trends be damned, and has delivered an incisively supercharged and ridiculously energized new landmark in the form of The Electric Age.<br><br> Overkill has never had an identity crisis. We know who we are and to chase something else would just kill the purity, says vocalist Bobby Blitz Ellsworth. This is who we are, love it or hate it. New tracks like album opener Come and Get It, Black Daze and Old Wounds, New Scars brim with the attitude and passion of a band at the top of their game, with Ellsworth's signature vocals rising to the top alongside the steady rhythmic backbone of fellow band cofounder, bassist and chief songwriter D.D. Verni, whose very own GEAR Studios once again served as the gestation location where the long-running New Jersey legends incubated their latest recorded beast.<br> Dave Linsk, lead guitarist for Overkill since 1999, ratchets up his signature shredding to uncharted levels alongside rhythm guitarist Derek The Skull Trailer. Ron Lipnicki fashions drum parts that always serve the songs first and foremost while tastefully displaying his formidable prowess behind the kit simultaneously.<br>We have a formula and that formula has worked for us for many years, Ellsworth explains of the writing and recording process Overkill has perfected. It's really a balance between trading files back and forth across the net but also being in the same room. D.D. starts with a riff and then it develops over time. When the riff comes, the riff comes. The actual sit down writing process was about eight months. It was getting the drums together, getting the boys together in the room, making riffs into songs, changing arrangements and seeing how it develops. How technology helps that is that you can do a WAV file from New Jersey to Florida - where Dave is - if he's not in the room. Songs can always be worked on even if you're not in the studio or together. So it's a combination of both. The Electric Age serves as an instant reminder as to why Overkill is held in high regard the world over as one of the pioneering thrash metal bands. Overkill's Years of Decay was recently<br>inducted into Decibel Magazine's lofty Hall Of Fame alongside similarly influential metal masterworks like Slayer's Reign in Blood, Anthrax's Among the Living and Metallica's ...And Justice for All. And truth be told, Overkill has maintained a level of excellence and consistency across their entire catalog that knows few rivals in any genre.""]"

Their first album came in 1979 but the fire has only burned brighter, as heard in the 2010 album, Blood of the Nations, which catapulted them back into the forefront of heavy metal. Inspired by their fans' awe-inspiring reaction to their explosive live shows as well as the grandiose success of that comeback album, the band bring us another collection of heavy metal classics. Stalingrad is every bit as voluminous as the band's legendary releases with new metal anthems that carry on their tradition of excellence. This vibrant and mesmerizing album harnesses everything that earned Accept the status of true heavy metal legends: thunderous riffs, blinding guitar leads, aggressive vocals and infectious, undiluted metal songs with a bite that are destined to keep Accept ahead of the pack. There truly is no rest for the wicked as the Teutonic terror continue their worldwide domination with a North American tour with Kreator, leaving all non-believers in their metallic dust!""]"

Not this band, not Queensrche. With every new release, Geoff Tate and company push themselves into new directions, new sounds, and dizzying new heights. The result is that Queensrche is just as vital and musically relevant today as ever they ever were. Even when they revisit older ideas, as they did in 2006 with the long awaited sequel to Operation: Mindcrime, the result was one of the most thrilling releases of their extraordinary career. Now, a new chapter is about to be written, a new album, and a new line-up that unites frontman Tate with a stellar group of new players and seasoned vets. Arguably the heaviest version of Queensrche ever assembled, the band not only wrote and recorded the 10 brand new songs on Frequency Unknown, but also will be hitting the road to perform the entire Operation: Mindcrime album at select venues across the nation in celebration of that album s 25th anniversary.

Lungs ran straight into the making, promoting and touring of the Grammy-nominated Ceremonials, an album written while on the road and recorded straight after coming off tour. The shows were getting bigger, the hair redder, the success wider and wilder. <br>HOW BLUE<br>A pop star at 21, with two international hit albums behind her, Florence discovered that in giving seven years to her music, some elements of real life had been left by the wayside. Coming back from tour and moving out of her mother s Camberwell home, Florence re-engaged with normal life: going out, falling in and out of love, and simply trying to learn how to look after herself outside of the hermetic bubble of life of the road. <br> It was sort of a crash landing Florence freely admits, I guess although I ve always dealt in fantasy and metaphor when I came to writing, that meant the songs this time were dealing much more in reality. Ceremonials was so fixated on death and water, and the idea of escape or transcendence through death, but the new album became about trying to learn how live, and how to love in the world rather than trying to escape from it. Which is frightening because I m not hiding behind anything but it felt like something I had to do. <br>And so the new Florence, and her songs, started to swim into focus. <br>HOW BEAUTIFUL<br>The result is How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, a collection of songs, written and recorded over the course of 2014. Produced by Markus Dravs (Bjrk, Arcade Fire, Coldplay) with contributions from Paul Epworth, Kid Harpoon and John Hill, the third album by Florence + the Machine is live-sounding, tune-rich, unhinged in all the right places and powerful in all the best ways. In voice and, ultimately, outlook Florence has never sounded better.<br> Markus has done a few Arcade Fire albums, Florence tells us, and he s done Bjrk s Homogenic, which is a huge record for me. And I felt he had that balance of organic and electronic capabilities, managing those two worlds. And, you know, he s good with big sounds. And I like big sounds. And he s good with trumpets, and I knew I wanted a brass section on this record, she adds of a group of musicians who were arranged by Will Gregory of Goldfrapp.<br> And with Markus, Florence continues, clarifying, I wanted to make something that was big but that had a gentleness to it. That had a warmth, that was rooted. I think that s why we went back more to the live instruments. Something that was band-led almost. <br>A prime example is the future Florence classic Ship To Wreck: it opens the album, and showcases Florence and Dravs enthusiasm for reframing her distinctive voice. <br> Ship To Wreck was written with Kid Harpoon, the London-based songwriter/producer with whom she d written Ceremonials Grammy-nominated Shake It Out , during a month-long creative furlough in Los Angeles that also yielded first single What Kind Of Man : a full-force ear-pinning anthem of uplifting defiance. <br>Kid Harpoon is one of a clutch of old collaborator friends who reunited to help marshal these most personal of songs. Ceremonials producer Paul Epworth helped create the album closing psychedelic blues explosion Mother, while the inner-circle of her nearest and dearest was rounded out by her bandmate and long-time studio right-hand-woman Isa Summers, with whom she wrote the epic title track. <br> How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful was the first song I wrote for this record, literally as I just came off tour, she explains, and then I went off and had this incredibly chaotic year, and that all went into the record. But in the end, the feeling of How Big How Blue is what']"

Steered by Grammy Award-winning British super- producer Steve Lillywhite (U2, Rolling Stones, Morrissey, Dave Matthews Band), <b><i>Carry On</b></i> is a mature and content departure from the acrimonious artist who brought us Soundgarden, Audioslave and Temple of the Dog.<P> The new album\'s fourteen tracks offer the bluesy and soulful ""Safe and Sound,"" psychedelic ""Scar On The Sky,"" country-flavored ""Finally Forever""... paeans to persistence in ""Disappearing Act"" and a slow-grind cover of Michael Jackson\'s ""Billy Jean"" that gives the familiar song a completely new feeling. More personal selections include ""Ghost,"" ""Arms Around Your Love"" and ""She\'ll Never Be Your Man"" and alt-rock experimentations (""Killing Birds"" the anthemic ""Silence the Voices""). Fans of Soundgarden and Audioslave will appreciate the harder edge of ""No Such Thing"" and ""Poison Eye"" and the redemptive ""Your Soul Today.""<P> <P><b><i>Carry On</b></i> also includes the Top 10 European smash hit ""You Know My Name,"" the main title song for the current James Bond theatrical release, <i>Casino Royale</i>, appearing for the first time on a full-length release. Cornell wrote and recorded the track with long-time James Bond composer David Arnold for the film.<P> <P>With this collection of songs, it is evident that Cornell was inspired by songwriters from Elvis Costello to Tom Waits. Cornell says that his own lyrical approach leans on stream-of-consciousness, ""getting out of my own way"" to allow themes to naturally arise, whether topical or biographical. ""The most exciting thing is to let yourself expose your true, vulnerable feelings, which is what resonates with people most,"" he explains. As far as his vocal style, he points to such R&B singers as Otis Redding and Aretha Franklin for showing masterfully how emotion can best be conveyed, even in subtle phrasing, also praising Bob Marley\'s expressive range and Tom Waits\' use of his voice as an instrument.<P>', 'Change has been a constant in Chris Cornell\'s life since Soundgarden split in 1997. Sober and over 40 now, he lives in France with his wife and daughter. His first solo album (1999\'s <i>Euphoria Morning</i>) was lauded in the press, but disregarded by the public. And his supergroup Audioslave eventually fizzled after a trio of albums. But on Cornell\'s long-awaited sophomore solo effort, it\'s obvious something hasn\'t been altered: the voice, a distinguished instrument still pure and resonant--and authoritative enough to take on Michael Jackson\'s ""Billie Jean"" and turn it from throbbing dancefloor anthem to portentous ballad. The unforeseen cover is sequenced midway through 14 tracks that have Cornell softening the edges of his music without losing the power of the messenger. No less than a half-dozen songs have hit potential, including ""Arms Around Your Love,"" with its soaring chorus, the R&amp;B-flecked ""She\'ll Never Be Your Man,"" and ""No Such Thing,"" where restrained verses give way to crunchy-riffed choruses. He uses the bluesy ""Safe and Sound"" to call for peace, asking ""Why can\'t we pull it together?"" Ten years after the breakup of his pioneering band, Chris Cornell has done just that, and it\'s evident that the change has done him good. <i>--Scott Holter</i>']"
